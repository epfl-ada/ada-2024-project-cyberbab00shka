    "### Selection of archetype categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The identification of prominent movie archetypes turned out to be a challenging task. A popular way to analyse archetypes in related literature is with a help of the website [Tv tropes](https://tvtropes.org/), which constitutes a large collection of archetypes gathered by tv viewers. We found that the majority of the archetypes presented on the web site are extremely specific and can be applied only to a handful of examples (see [A Chat with Satan](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChatWithSatan), [The Drunken Sailor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrunkenSailor), [Mock Millionaire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MockMillionaire)). Such specific tropes limit the amount of available data, rendering the search of correlation much harder and making the insights less impactful. In our analysis we wanted to see a broader picture.Therefore it was necessary to devise a set of broad and popular archetypes. As a basis, a [list of archetypal tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter) was taken from the TV tropes website. Based on this list we tried to join some archetypes into more general categories. As a result, the following list of archetypes has emerged:\n",
