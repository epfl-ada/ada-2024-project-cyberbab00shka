After being introduced to criminals Carl Showalter  and Gaear Grimsrud  by Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot , a mechanic at his dealership, Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, and hires the two men to kidnap his wife Jean  in exchange for a new car and half of the $80,000 ransom. However, Jerry intends to demand a much larger sum from his wealthy father-in-law, Wade Gustafson , and keep most of the money for himself. GMAC has been threatening to withdraw loans for cars at the dealership Jerry manages after accounting irregularities. Jerry has been trying to raise money by promoting a real estate deal to Wade. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping after Wade agrees to the investment, but he is too late, and, as it turns out, Wade intends to buy the property himself, giving Jerry only a finder's fee, which is not enough to pay off his debts. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean, but on their way through Brainerd, a Minnesota State Patrol officer stops them because of the car's license plates. When Carl's attempt to bribe the trooper fails, Gaear kills the trooper. As Carl is moving the trooper's body off the road, he is seen by a couple passing by in their car. Gaear chases the couple, who lose control of their car and swerve off the road, enabling Gaear to kill them. The deaths are investigated by local police chief Marge Gunderson , who is seven months pregnant. She deduces the chain of events and follows the leads that arise, interviewing two prostitutes who serviced the criminals and tracing the license plates on their vehicle to Jerry's dealership. After being informed that the criminals telephoned Shep Proudfoot, she drives to Minneapolis, but acquires no information in interviews with Shep and Jerry. Jerry contacts Wade, saying that the kidnappers insist on dealing only with Jerry. Wade accepts this arrangement at first, but later changes his mind. When he meets with Carl at a parking garage, he refuses to give him the money until his daughter is returned. Angered by his demands and unexpected appearance, Carl shoots Wade. Before he dies, Wade shoots Carl in the face. Carl then kills the garage attendant on his way out. Jerry arrives at the scene just after Carl leaves. Later, Carl discovers that the bag he took from Wade contains a million dollars and buries most of the money by the side of the highway. At the hideout, Gaear has killed Jean, and, in a dispute over the car, he kills Carl with an axe. Before leaving town, Marge questions Jerry again, asking him about the car used in the Brainerd murders. When she asks to talk to Wade, Jerry storms out of the office, saying he will check the lot for the missing car but flees instead. Marge phones the state police to find and arrest him, then, following up on a tip, she drives to the lake, sees the kidnappers' car, and arrives just in time to see Gaear feeding the last of Carl's body into a wood chipper. Gaear tries to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Jerry is later arrested in a motel outside of Bismarck, North Dakota. Marge and her husband, Norm , sit in bed together discussing his artwork, which has been selected as the design for a postage stamp.\n","\n","Question:\n","With which of the provided archetypes does \"Jerry Lundegaard\" align best?\n","Stupid Crooks"]}],"source":["from src.models.persona_identification import PersonaIdentification\n","from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","\n","SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a movie expert specializing in character archetypes.

Fox). Marty D is a friend of scientist, Doc (Christopher Llyod). Doc asks Marty to meet him that night at the Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 a.m.. Marty asks him where he's been all week. Marty's girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) is his classmate at high school where Marty is always in trouble for being friends with Doc. Marty's dad George is a big league loser. & puts up with all kinds of nonsense from his supervisor Biff who totally rides rod-shod over George. Marty's mum Lorraine behaves like a nun & doesn't allow Marty any kind of freedom with Jennifer. The town clock tower was stuck by lightning 30 yrs ago & has been shut ever since. Marty has brother Dave & sister Linda. Lorraine's brother Joey was in jail & is just being released. Lorraine also reveals how she met George. George was in a tree, & was hit by Lorraine's dad's car who brought him home when he fell. Lorraine asked George to prom out of sympathy & when George kissed him at the dance, she decided to marry him. at 1 am Marty heads to twin pines mall to meet Doc who is with his modified Delorean car. Doc demonstrates that his car is a time machine, works on Plutonium & starts at 88 mph. Doc reveals that he got the Plutonium from Libyan terrorists who wanted a bomb, but Doc delivered a fake. Libyans attack & kill Doc. Marty hide in the car & accelerate to 88 mph & travel back in time to 1955 (the year Doc discovered the time machine formula). Marty realizes he has landed in the past & tries to find Doc. He finds young George being bullied by young Biff. George has a penchant for peeping & falls from a tree on to the path on an oncoming car. Marty pushes him & gets hit himself. The car owner takes Marty home. Marty wakes to young Lorraine looking seductively at Marty. Marty finds Doc & shows him the car to prove that he is from future. Doc promises Marty to get him back to 1985. The car required 1.21 GW, & in absence of plutonium only a lightning bolt will work. MArty remembers that the clock tower was stuck by lightning in 1955 & tells Doc. Doc also tells Marty that his messing with events in 1955 can impact the future. Already Marty can see his brother disappear from his wallet family photo. Marty has to get George & Lorraine together, but Lorraine loves Marty. Marty foiling Biff's plans to humiliate George only endear Marty even more to Lorraine. Lorraine asks Marty to dance & Marty tells George that he will try to take advantage of Lorraine & George can step in & be a hero. At the night of the dance & the night of the lightning bolt, Marty slips a note into Doc's coat saying that he was killed by Libyans in 1985. Marty is with Lorraine when Biff pushes Marty & takes Lorraine into his car & starts molesting her. George arrives & starts to rescue Lorraine, but its Biff. George is humiliated again, but summons the strength to knock Biff out. Marty meets Doc who has hooked a cable from the clock tower to the car to provide the power. Marty drives the car & gets it to 88 mph, just as lightening strikes & gets back to 1985. He finds Doc who is on his back & is distraught. But Doc is OK as he was wearing a bullet proof vest based on Marty's note. George and Lorraine arrive home from a tennis match, happy and even a bit frisky. Lorraine asks Marty about the camping trip he has planned with Jennifer, to which Marty mentions that the car is wrecked. Everyone starts barking about it until George shows them that Biff is waxing the car (a BMW) in the driveway. Biff comes into the house carrying a box filled with copies of George's first published book.\n","\n","I'm trying to identify the archetype of the character \"George McFly\" in this movie.
