After being introduced to criminals Carl Showalter  and Gaear Grimsrud  by Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot , a mechanic at his dealership, Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, and hires the two men to kidnap his wife Jean  in exchange for a new car and half of the $80,000 ransom. However, Jerry intends to demand a much larger sum from his wealthy father-in-law, Wade Gustafson , and keep most of the money for himself. GMAC has been threatening to withdraw loans for cars at the dealership Jerry manages after accounting irregularities. Jerry has been trying to raise money by promoting a real estate deal to Wade. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping after Wade agrees to the investment, but he is too late, and, as it turns out, Wade intends to buy the property himself, giving Jerry only a finder's fee, which is not enough to pay off his debts. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean, but on their way through Brainerd, a Minnesota State Patrol officer stops them because of the car's license plates. When Carl's attempt to bribe the trooper fails, Gaear kills the trooper. As Carl is moving the trooper's body off the road, he is seen by a couple passing by in their car. Gaear chases the couple, who lose control of their car and swerve off the road, enabling Gaear to kill them. The deaths are investigated by local police chief Marge Gunderson , who is seven months pregnant. She deduces the chain of events and follows the leads that arise, interviewing two prostitutes who serviced the criminals and tracing the license plates on their vehicle to Jerry's dealership. After being informed that the criminals telephoned Shep Proudfoot, she drives to Minneapolis, but acquires no information in interviews with Shep and Jerry. Jerry contacts Wade, saying that the kidnappers insist on dealing only with Jerry. Wade accepts this arrangement at first, but later changes his mind. When he meets with Carl at a parking garage, he refuses to give him the money until his daughter is returned. Angered by his demands and unexpected appearance, Carl shoots Wade. Before he dies, Wade shoots Carl in the face. Carl then kills the garage attendant on his way out. Jerry arrives at the scene just after Carl leaves. Later, Carl discovers that the bag he took from Wade contains a million dollars and buries most of the money by the side of the highway. At the hideout, Gaear has killed Jean, and, in a dispute over the car, he kills Carl with an axe. Before leaving town, Marge questions Jerry again, asking him about the car used in the Brainerd murders. When she asks to talk to Wade, Jerry storms out of the office, saying he will check the lot for the missing car but flees instead. Marge phones the state police to find and arrest him, then, following up on a tip, she drives to the lake, sees the kidnappers' car, and arrives just in time to see Gaear feeding the last of Carl's body into a wood chipper. Gaear tries to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Jerry is later arrested in a motel outside of Bismarck, North Dakota. Marge and her husband, Norm , sit in bed together discussing his artwork, which has been selected as the design for a postage stamp.\n","\n","Question:\n","With which of the provided archetypes does \"Jerry Lundegaard\" align best?\n","Stupid Crooks"]}],"source":["from src.models.persona_identification import PersonaIdentification\n","from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","\n","SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"You are a movie expert specializing in character archetypes.

After learning the assignment relates to the pursuit of vicious serial killer Buffalo Bill, Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and is led by Dr. Frederick Chilton to Hannibal Lecter, a sophisticated, cultured man restrained behind thick glass panels and windowless stone walls. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling\\'s attempts at \"dissecting\" him and viciously rebuffs her. As Starling departs, another patient flings fresh semen onto her face, enraging Lecter who calls Starling back and offers a riddle containing information about a former patient. The solved riddle leads to a rent-a-storage lot where the severed head of Benjamin Raspail is found. Starling returns to Lecter, who links Raspail to Buffalo Bill and who offers to help profile Buffalo Bill if he is transferred to a facility far from the venomous, careerist Dr. Chilton.\\n\\nHours and miles away, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of United States Senator Ruth Martin. Starling is pulled from Quantico and accompanies Crawford to West Virginia, where the body of Bill\\'s most recently-discovered victim resides. In the plane taking them to the town, Crawford asks Starling what she sees in the file on Buffalo Bill. She says that Bill is a male, definitely white and that he\\'s getting better at his work since he\\'s \"developed a taste for it\". At the coroner\\'s office, Starling helps perform the autopsy and extracts the chrysalis of a Death\\'s-head Hawkmoth from the victim\\'s throat. When the victim is turned over for further examination, they find that two large, diamond-shaped strips of flesh have been flayed from her body. Having already spoken to Lecter about how Bill flays his victims, this detail is recorded by Starling.\\n\\nAt Quantico, as news of Catherine Martin\\'s abduction sweeps the country, Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Hannibal Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps profile Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine Martin. Instead, Lecter begins a game of \"quid pro quo\" with Starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about Buffalo Bill in exchange for events from Starling\\'s traumatic childhood. Unaware to both Starling and Lecter, Dr. Frederick Chilton tapes the conversation and after revealing Starling\\'s deal as a sham, offers to transfer Lecter in exchange for a deal of his own making, one that will make Chilton out as a hero for identifying and tracking down Buffalo Bill. Lecter agrees and following a flight to Tennessee reveals Buffalo Bill\\'s real name, physical description and past address to Senator Martin and her entourage of FBI agents and Justice Department officials. He also insults Martin openly, asking about her breastfeeding of her daughter. Martin orders Lecter back to Baltimore when he spills Buffalo Bill\\'s identity information.\\n\\nAs the manhunt begins, Starling travels to Lecter\\'s special cell in a local Tennessee courthouse, where she confronts him about the false information he gave the Senator. Lecter refuses Starling\\'s pleas and demands she finish her story surrounding her worst childhood memory. After recounting her arrival at a relative\\'s farm, the horror of discovering their lamb slaughterhouse and her fruitless attempts at rescuing the lambs -- they screamed as they were being slaughtered, a memory that has haunted Starling her whole life -- Lecter rebuffs her, leaving her with her case file before she is escorted out of the building by security guards. As she reaches for the file, he touches one of her fingers.\\n\\nLater that evening, Lecter escapes from his cell, his two minders distracted by having to move his sketches and tricking them into approaching him too closely. The local police storm the floor, discovering one guard barely alive and the other disemboweled and strung up on the bars of Lecter\\'s cage like an angel. Paramedics transport the survivor to an ambulance and speed off while a SWAT team searches the building for Lecter. As the team discover a body on top of the elevator car, the survivor in the ambulance peels off his own face, revealing Lecter in disguise, who kills the paramedics and escapes to the airport.\\n\\nAfter being notified of Lecter\\'s escape, Starling pores over her case file, analyzing Lecter\\'s annotations before realizing that the first victim, Frederica Bimmel, knew Bill in real life before he killed her. Starling travels to Bimmel\\'s hometown and discovers that Bimmel was a tailor and has dresses with templates identical to the patches of skin removed from Buffalo Bill\\'s victims. Realizing that Buffalo Bill is a tailor fashioning a \"woman suit\" of real skin, she telephones Crawford, who is already on the way to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter\\'s notes with Johns Hopkins Hospital and finding a man named Jame Gumb. Crawford instructs Starling to continue interviewing Bimmel\\'s friends while he leads a SWAT team to Gumb\\'s business address in Calumet City, Illinois.

Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a Rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader. Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby planet of Tatooine. Darth Vader learns of this and orders the Imperials to pursue the droids.\\n\\nThe droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a recording of Leia requesting help from a former ally named Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 goes missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by Sand People. He is rescued by the elderly hermit Ben Kenobi, who soon reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. He tells Luke about his past as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from the Force but were hunted to near-extinction by the Empire. Luke learns that his father, also a Jedi, fought alongside Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's lightsaber, the signature weapon of the Jedi.R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, but he is left with no choice after Imperial stormtroopers murdered his family and destroyed his home while searching for the droids. Seeking a way off the planet, Luke and Obi-Wan travel to the city of Mos Eisley and hire Han Solo and Chewbacca, pilots of the starship Millennium Falcon. Before the Falcon reaches Alderaan, the Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin has the planet obliterated by the station's superlaser.[5] Upon arrival, the Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, but the passengers avoid detection and infiltrate the station. As Obi-Wan leaves to deactivate the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the Rebel base. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, which allows the rest of the group to escape. Using a tracking device placed on the Falcon, the Empire locates the Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4.\\n\\nAnalysis of the Death Star schematics reveals a weakness in a small exhaust port leading directly to the station's reactor. Luke joins the Rebellion's X-wing squadron in a desperate attack against the Death Star, while Han and Chewbacca leave to pay off a debt to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. In the ensuing battle, Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and destroys several Rebel ships. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return in the Falcon, knocking Vader's ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the Death Star to explode moments before it can fire on the Rebel base.

Late that night, he returns with water for the dying man, but is chased away by two men in a truck and loses his vehicle. Moss escapes due to his extensive knowledge of the area which his pursuers lack.

He has already strangled a sheriff\\'s deputy to escape custody and stolen a car by using a captive bolt pistol to kill the driver. Chigurh is a vicious killer but does not kill indiscriminately. His peculiar habit is that he tosses a coin & asks his victim to guess heads or tail. If they guess correctly, he spares their life.\\n\\nBell is on the trail of the killings as well. In the meantime, Chigurh arrives at the scene of the drug deal & finds Moss\\'s abandoned truck. He has been employed by the buyers to recover their money & they hand over the tracking device to him. Chigurh shoots them dead & starts tracing Moss.\\n\\nNow he carries a receiver that traces the money via a tracking device concealed inside the satchel. Bursting into Moss\\'s hideout at night, Chigurh surprises a group of Mexicans set to ambush Moss and murders them all. Moss, who has rented the connecting room on the other side, is one step ahead. By the time Chigurh removes the vent cover with a dime, Moss is already back on the road with the cash.\\n\\nIn a border town hotel, Moss finally finds the electronic bug, but not before Chigurh is upon him. A firefight between them spills onto the streets, leaving both men wounded. Moss flees across the border & hides the money in a ditch near the border & collapses from his injuries before he is taken to a Mexican hospital.

When she tells him she does not have the money, he recalls the pledge he made to her husband that could have spared her, had Moss accepted Chigurh\\'s offer to return the money. The best he will offer Carla is a coin toss for her life, but she says that the choice is his. Chigurh leaves the house alone and carefully checks the soles of his boots, suggesting he killed Carla Jean.

Thanos\\'s lieutenants duly arrive on Earth in their massive spaceship.\\n\\nHulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos\\' plan to kill half of all life in the universe. In response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Thanos used to attack each planet one by one, killing half the population, but found that the process was too slow and the problem too big.

Quill is unable to kill Gamora as he hesitates and by then Thanos changes reality again and uses the Space Stone to take Gamora to his ship. Thanos argues that ever since he eliminated half the population on Gamora\\'s planet, the children have are well-nourished and enjoy a healthier world.

Aladdin comes to her rescue, and together they get chased by the Royal Guards. After a while they elude their pursuers, and Aladdin takes the girl to his place for some tea. The girl calls herself Dalia, and is the handmaiden to the Princess of Agrabah. She suddenly has to leave as another suitor for the princess, Prince Anders, arrives. Dalia happens to be Princess Jasmine and Dalia is the name of her handmaid and best friend. Meanwhile, The Sultan\\'s trusted councilor, Jafar, is plotting to overthrown the Sultan by getting his hands on the Magic Lamp. However, it is hidden in a enchanted Cave of Wonders, and only the \"Diamond in the Rough\" may enter, which he is not. So, he spends weeks searching for this Diamond in the Rough.\\n\\nOne evening, after turning down Prince Anders\\' hand in marriage, Jasmine receives a surprise visit from Aladdin, who has come to return her mother\\'s bracelet, which Abu stole. Still thinking she\\'s Delia, he leaves her with a promise to meet her again, but is caught by the royal guards. The next day, Aladdin finds himself in the desert with Jafar, who assumes that he is the Diamond in the Rough. He tells Aladdin that the girl he met was the princess and that he can make him rich enough to impress her if he helps him retrieve the lamp. By evening, they arrive at the cave, and since Aladdin is the Diamond in the Rough he is permitted to enter the cave safely. The Cave of Wonders is filled with wondrous treasures that tempt both Aladdin and Abu. However, they have been warned to only retrieve the lamp and not to be tempted by the treasure otherwise they would be trapped inside the cave forever. Along the way they meet a Magic Carpet and find the lamp. However, Abu becomes tempted by a big shiny ruby and takes it. This angers the spirit of the cave, and starts to cave in. Aladdin and Abu barely make it back with Carpet\\'s help, but end up trapped in the cave after Jafar takes the lamp and betrays him.\\n\\nTrapped inside the cave, Abu reveals that he stole the lamp back from Jafar. Aladdin notices the lamp is a bit dusty and gives it a rub. This causes the lamp to release a powerful Genie who can grant him three wishes, as long as he is holding the lamp. Aladdin wishes to escape from the cave (though he makes a wish without holding the lamp, keeping his three wishes in tact), and both he, Genie, Abu and Carpet find themselves in the middle of the desert. After seeing Genie\\'s potential, Aladdin wishes to become a prince in the hopes that he can be with Princess Jasmine. Genie transforms him into Prince Ali, and parade to The Sultan\\'s Palace, where the Sultan welcomes him.\\n\\nAladdin starts off a bit awkward being a prince and trying to impress Jasmine, especially when Genie has him dance spectacularly in front of the princess. Instead of being impressed she just leaves. Meanwhile, Jafar becomes suspicious of Prince Ali.\\n\\nLater, Aladdin decides to go and Jasmine in her room, while Genie takes Delia out for a late night stroll. By just being himself, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a magic carpet ride, where the two of them become close.

Then he takes Jasmine back to the palace and they share their first kiss.\\n\\nThe next day however, Jafar captures Aladdin, who has figured out who he really is. He threatens to have him thrown into bay unless he tells him where the lamp is. When Aladdin denies everything, Jafar personally pushes him out of his tower and falls into the sea.

This makes Aladdin decide not to use his last wish to set Genie free as he promised, as he believes he cannot keep up being a prince without him. Genie is disappointed that Aladdin wants to continue living a lie and retreats to his lamp. Aladdin goes back to his old home in deep thought, and comes to see that Genie is right.

Jafar now has them at his mercy, declaring him the most powerful man in the world. However, Aladdin retorts by claiming Jafar is not as powerful as he wishes to believe. The Genie remains the most powerful being in the universe as he gave Jafar his power in the first place and can also take it away. Realizing what Aladdin says is true and that he is still just \"second-best\", Jafar uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie.

The Agents offer to erase Neo\\'s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist.

He is then brought aboard Morpheus\\'s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the history: in the early 21st century, humanity had developed intelligent machines before war broke out between the two sides. After humans blocked the machines\\' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\\n\\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix\\'s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo\\'s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus\\'s belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus\\'s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\\n\\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix, murders three crew members, and severely wounds a fourth, Tank. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists on accompanying him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\\n\\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo.

Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Sam (Sean Astin) to Bree, with plans to meet him there after Gandalf goes to Isengard to meet the head of his order, Saruman (Christopher Lee). Saruman reveals that the Nazgul, or Ringwraiths, have left Mordor to capture the Ring and kill whoever carries it; having already turned to Sauron\\'s cause, he then imprisons Gandalf atop Orthanc.\\n\\nFrodo and Sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). After encountering a Ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach Bree, and there they meet a Man called Strider (Viggo Mortensen), who agrees to lead them to Rivendell. They agree only because Gandalf isn\\'t there to guide them. After some travelling, they spend the night on the hill of Weathertop, where they are attacked by the Nazgul at night. Strider fights off the Ringwraiths, but Frodo is grievously wounded with a Morgul blade, and they must quickly get him to Rivendell for healing. While chased by the Nazgul, Frodo is taken by the elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) (also Strider\\'s beloved) to the elvish haven of Rivendell, and healed by her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving).\\n\\nIn Rivendell Frodo meets Gandalf, who explains why he didn\\'t meet them at Bree as planned. In the meantime, there are many meetings between various peoples, and Elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the Ring. The Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires (that is, lava) of Mount Doom, where it was forged. Mount Doom is located in Mordor, near Sauron\\'s fortress of Barad-Dur, and will be an incredibly dangerous journey. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom as all the others argue about who should or shouldn\\'t take it. He is accompanied by his hobbit friends and Gandalf, as well as Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chain-mail shirt made of Mithril.\\n\\nAlso travelling with them are the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Boromir (Sean Bean), the son of the Steward of Gondor. Together they comprise the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain Caradhras, but they are stopped by Saruman\\'s wizardry. They are forced to travel under the mountain through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After journeying partway through the Mines, Pippin accidentally gives away their presence to a band of orcs. The Fellowship then encounter a Balrog (Durin\\'s Bane is a Balrog residing within the mines), an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him.\\n\\nThe group flees to the elvish realm of Lothlorien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, Galadriel and her husband Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-Hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship. After resting, they decide to travel on the River Anduin towards Parth Galen. Before they leave, Galadriel gives Frodo the Phial of Galadriel. After landing at Parth Galen, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, who manages to escape by putting the Ring on his finger and vanishing. Knowing that the Ring\\'s temptation will be too strong for the Fellowship, Frodo decides to leave them and go to Mordor alone.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship are attacked by Uruk-Hai. Merry and Pippin, realizing that Frodo is leaving, distract the orcs, allowing Frodo to escape. Boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits but is mortally wounded by the orc commander Lurtz, and Merry and Pippin are captured. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find Boromir, who regrets attempting to steal the Ring and dies. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Antagonist'},\n","   {'character_name': 'The Joker',\n","    'movie_name': 'The Dark Knight',\n","    'summary': 'A gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.\\n\\nMcMurphy\\'s ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. McMurphy finds that they are more fearful of Ratched than they are focused on becoming functional in the outside world. McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell); and \"Chief\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent American Indian believed to be deaf and mute.\\n\\nMcMurphy\\'s and Ratched\\'s battle of wills escalates rapidly. When McMurphy\\'s card games win away everyone\\'s cigarettes, Ratched confiscates the cigarettes and rations them out. McMurphy calls for votes on ward policy changes to challenge her. He makes a show of betting the other patients he can escape by lifting an old hydrotherapy console-a massive marble plumbing fixture-off the floor and sending it through the window; when he fails to do so, he turns to them and says, \"But I tried goddammit. At least I did that.\"\\n\\nMcMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them: \"You\\'re not nuts, you are fishermen!\" and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination. Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group humiliation sessions, Cheswick\\'s agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind-up brawling with the orderlies.\\n\\nThey are sent up to the \"shock shop\" for Electro-Convulsive therapy. While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs \"Thank you.\" McMurphy is delighted to find that Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and that he stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning illness, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the ECT only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will \"light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars.\"\\n\\nBut the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a Christmas party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and enjoys a bacchanalian rampage. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital-though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there. Billy and Candy agree, and they retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.\\n\\nNurse Ratched arrives the next morning and discovers the scene: the ward completely upended, and patients passed out all over the floor.

When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Nurse Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy\\'s mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself in the face; locked in the doctor\\'s office, he kills himself. McMurphy, enraged at Nurse Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.\\n\\nSometime later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy\\'s patter.

Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state-or be seen this way by the other patients-the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow.

The wreck rests on the ocean floor, 3821 meters below the surface. They recover Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley\\'s (Billy Zane) safe, believing the necklace to be inside, but only find a sketch of a nude woman wearing the diamond, dated April 14, 1912, the night the Titanic hit the iceberg. The expedition is privately funded and hence Brock is under pressure to deliver the diamond to his investors. Hearing about the drawing on the TV news, an elderly woman named Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart) calls Lovett and claims that she is the woman depicted in the drawing. She and her granddaughter, Lizzy Calvert (Suzy Amis), visit him and his team on his salvage ship. Rose is 101 years old and all the details about her convince Brock that she was on the ship on the night of its accident. She was the last person who wore the Heart of the Ocean. Brock knows that Cal\\'s father Nathan had settled an insurance claim for the loss of the diamond, that Cal had bought for his fiance, just before the Titanic sailed from England.\\n\\nBrock takes Rose through a quick simulation of the Titanic Iceberg collision. It hit the berg on the starboard side, which punched holes across a wide section of the hull. The water entered several water-tight compartments and eventually rose over the bulkheads (which did not go above the E deck) to spill over to the other water-tight compartments astern. The ship tilts as the stern rises out of the water and eventually splits into 2 parts right down the middle. The front section goes under first, followed shortly by the stern section. The ship sinks at 2:20 AM, 2 hours and 40 minutes after the ship hit the iceberg. When asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose recalls her time aboard the Titanic, revealing that she is Rose DeWitt Bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking.\\n\\nShe then begins her story as follows: In 1912, 17-year-old first class passenger Rose (Kate Winslet) boards \"Titanic\" in Southampton with her fiance Cal and her mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Titanic is making her first voyage and is considered to be \"unsinkable\". Ruth stresses the importance of Rose\\'s engagement, as the marriage would solve the DeWitt Bukaters\\' secret financial problems.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Jack and his Italian friend Fabrizio (Danny Nucci) board the Titanic at the last possible minute by winning 3rd class tickets for the voyage in a poker game against Irish immigrants. Margaret \"Molly\" Brown (Kathy Bates) boarded the ship at Cherbourg. Molly was looked down upon by the other first-class passengers for being \"new\" money. The next day, Titanic sails west at 21 knots. The Titanic is captained by Edward John Smith (Bernard Hill) and was designed by Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber). Edward\\'s staff includes Chief Officer Henry Wilde (Mark Lindsay Chapman), First Officer William Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Second Officer Charles Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips) and Third Officer Herbert Pitman (Kevin De La Noy). J Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde) is the MD of the White Star Line, the owners of the Titanic.\\n\\nDistraught by her engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping off the ship\\'s stern. Rose climbs over the astern rails as she decides whether to jump. A drifter and artist named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) stops her and pulls her back on deck when she slips and hangs off the rails. Discovered with Jack on the stern, Rose tells Cal that she was looking over the ship\\'s edge in curiosity and that Jack saved her from falling. At Rose\\'s insistence, Cal invites Jack to dinner the following night to show his appreciation. That night Cal gifts Rose the Heart of the Ocean diamond, in a necklace. Ismay orders Edwards to light the last 4 boilers of the Titanic and speed the ship up, even though there were reports of Icebergs on their route. Ismay wanted to showcase the speed of the ship by arriving ahead of time in New York. Rose notices that the ship is carrying only enough lifeboats for half the passengers on the ship. Andrews says that an extra row of lifeboats would make the ship look cluttered and hence he was overruled.\\n\\nJack and Rose develop a tentative friendship (and she learns that Jack is a professional painter who specializes in painting nudes), even though Cal and Ruth are wary of the young third-class man. Following the first-class dinner that night, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in the ship\\'s third-class quarter. They engage in some Irish tap dancing and Jack shows Rose a mighty good time, where she gets to enjoy a hearty laugh for the first time in her life.\\n\\nCal and Ruth forbid her to see Jack (Cal even hits Rose when she attempts to stand up for herself), and Rose attempts to rebuff Jack\\'s continuing advances. She soon realizes, though, that she prefers him over Cal, and meets him at the bow of the ship during what turns out to be the Titanic\\'s final moments of daylight. They then go to Rose\\'s stateroom, where she asks Jack to sketch her while naked and wearing the Heart of the Ocean, Cal\\'s engagement present to her. Afterward, the two evade Cal\\'s bodyguard Spicer Lovejoy (David Warner) and make love inside a car in the ship\\'s cargo hold. Going afterwards to the ship\\'s forward well deck, they witness the ship\\'s collision with an iceberg. Due to the calm seas, the iceberg was detected very late, and then it took long for the ship to change direction to avoid collision. As a result, instead of hitting the berg head on (which would have been better for survival), the ship grazes the berg on its starboard side, and punches holes across the hull. The first officer closes all the watertight doors that go up to Deck E. Jack and Rose overhear the ship\\'s officers and designer outline its seriousness. Rose tells Jack that they should warn her mother and Cal. Andrews says that 5 compartments of the ship are punctured (which is one compartment more punctured than what the ship was designed to stay afloat), which means the ship will sink. The ship has 2 hours at the most according to Andrews. The ship has 2200 souls on board. The captain issues a distress call by the radio at their current coordinates. The nearest ship is 4 hours away.\\n\\nCal discovers Jack\\'s drawing and a mocking note from Rose in his safe along with the necklace. Cal reports the diamond stolen. Furious, Cal has his bodyguard slip the necklace into Jack\\'s coat pocket. Accused of stealing it, Jack is arrested, taken down to the Master-at-arms\\' office and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his coat. Rose runs away from Cal and her mother (who has boarded a lifeboat) and releases Jack. The ship then starts to launch flares in order to attract any nearby ships. The third-class passengers are not allowed on to the lifeboat decks and are locked below. Meanwhile, lifeboats are launched half empty with only first-class passengers.\\n\\nOnce Jack and Rose reach the deck, Cal and Jack persuade her to board another lifeboat, Cal claiming that he has arranged for himself and Jack to get off safely. After she boards, Cal tells Jack that the arrangement is only for himself. As Rose\\'s boat lowers, she realizes that she cannot leave Jack, and jumps back on board the Titanic to reunite with him. Infuriated, Cal takes a pistol and chases them into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After exhausting his ammunition, Cal realizes to his chagrin that he gave his coat with the diamond to Rose. With the situation now dire, he returns to the boat deck and boards a lifeboat by pretending to look after a lost child. The engineers of the titanic are credited with keeping the lights on till the last possible moment. The musicians of the Titanic were a septet orchestra who performed chamber music in the first-class section aboard the ship. The group is noted for playing music, intending to calm the passengers for as long as they possibly could, during the ship\\'s sinking.\\n\\nJack and Rose return to the top deck. All lifeboats have departed, and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, and the stern side rises 90-degrees into the air. As it sinks, Jack and Rose ride the stern into the ocean. Jack helps Rose onto a wall panel only able to support one person\\'s weight. Holding the panel\\'s edge, he assures her she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Meanwhile, Fifth Officer Harold Lowe has commandeered a lifeboat to search for survivors. He saves Rose but is unable to reach Jack before he dies from hypothermia.\\n\\nRose and the other survivors are taken by the RMS Carpathia to New York, where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. She hides from Cal on Carpathia\\'s deck as he searches for her. She learns later that he committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\\n\\nHer story complete, Rose goes alone to the stern of Lovett\\'s ship. There she takes out the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the ocean. While seemingly asleep in her bed, the photos on her dresser are a visual chronicle that she lived a free life inspired by Jack. The young Rose is then seen reuniting with Jack at the Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic, applauded and congratulated by those who perished on the ship.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Other'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Elizabeth Swann',\n","    'movie_name': 'Pirates of the Caribbean',\n","    'summary': 'In the 18th century, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and his daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), sail aboard HMS Dauntless.

Although she gives her name as \"Elizabeth Turner\" to conceal her identity as the governor\\'s daughter, Barbossa takes Elizabeth with them upon hearing the name \"Turner\".\\n\\nBarbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 Aztec gold pieces in a stone chest used to bribe Cortes to stop his slaughter, but because of Cortes\\'s greed, the heathen Gods placed a curse on the gold. Any man who spent even a single piece of this gold would be punished for eternity. Barbossa\\'s crew found the treasure at Isla De Muerta, but after spending it, they feel and taste nothing, and turn into immortal Undead skeletons in the moonlight. To lift the curse, Barbossa\\'s crew must return all the gold with their blood.

To save Elizabeth, Will frees Jack, who learns that Turner is the son of Bootstrap Bill. Jack agrees to take Will to the Black Pearl and to Elizabeth. Jack says that the Black Pearl berths at Isla De Muerta. They distract Norrington with a staged attempt to steal the Dauntless, allowing them to commandeer the HMS Interceptor. Jack says that Will\\'s father Bootstrap Bill was a pirate, which dismays Will. They head to Tortuga to find Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally) and recruit a crew. Gibbs agrees to join Jack when he learns that Will is the only living son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. Will learns from Gibbs that Sparrow was captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa organized a mutiny and marooned him on an island. Jack was given a pistol with one bullet in it. Despite going mad with heat, Jack saved the shot for Barbossa. He escaped the island by roping together sea turtles and making a raft.\\n\\nArriving at Isla De Muerta, Jack and Will sneak into the treasure grotto, where Barbossa fails to lift the curse with Elizabeth\\'s \"Turner\" blood. Barbossa is livid since the pirates have waited for 10 years to repay the terms of the curse. Barbossa wants Elizabeth to reveal who is the real child of Bill Turner. As the pirate crew bicker among each other, Will and Elizabeth escape with the medallion on the Interceptor, while Sparrow is captured by Barbossa and locked in the brig aboard the Pearl, when Jack says that he knows the identity of the real Turner child.\\n\\nA battle ensues between the Pearl and the Interceptor, with the crew captured and the ship destroyed. Having realized it is his blood Barbossa needs, Will surrenders himself to ensure Elizabeth\\'s freedom. Barbossa agrees but maroons Jack and Elizabeth on an Island. It is the same island where Jack was marooned before by Barbossa. Jack reveals that run runners used the island as a base to store their rum, and Jack was able to barter a passage with them after waiting for only 3 days. But now, the rum runners are out of business due to Norrington. The next morning, Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, then Jack and Elizabeth are rescued aboard the Dauntless. Elizabeth accepts Norrington\\'s marriage proposal on the condition to rescue Will from Barbossa.\\n\\nThat night, Jack and Norrington make a plan to ambush the pirates at Isla De Muerta, but Norrington plans to ambush the pirates himself and Sparrow convinces Barbossa to not lift the curse until after they\\'ve killed Norrington\\'s men.

While making the difficult journey to Ra\\'s\\' monastery at the top of a nearby mountain range, he picks a strange blue flower which is used later in a test as an hallucinogen to force him to face his greatest fear. As he completes his training, Bruce learns of the League\\'s true intentions: to liberate Gotham from the evils that plague it by destroying the city. He burns down the League\\'s temple, killing Ra\\'s, while saving the life of Ducard.\\n\\nBruce returns to Gotham. While publicly posing as a reckless playboy, he takes an interest in his family\\'s company, Wayne Enterprises, a technology and defense conglomerate run by the unscrupulous CEO William Earle, who intends to take the company public. Bruce meets Lucius Fox, head of the Applied Sciences division, who introduces him to several of Wayne\\'s experimental prototype technologies, including an armored car, the \"Tumbler\" and protective bodysuit, which Bruce uses to create his crime-fighting persona, Batman. As Batman, Bruce uses sophisticated surveillance equipment to spy on Falcone\\'s meetings and illegal smuggling operations in the city. He uses his fearsome persona in costume to interrogate a corrupt detective, Flass (Mark Boone Jr) about the drug shipments. Batman intercepts an illegal drug shipment and turns the captured Falcone over to Sgt. Jim Gordon and the Gotham police. Meanwhile, a Wayne Enterprises cargo ship is raided and an experimental weapon is stolen, a \"Microwave Emitter\" that uses microwaves to vaporize an enemy\\'s water supply.\\n\\nBack in Gotham, Falcone and his henchmen are declared mentally unfit for trial and transferred to Arkham Asylum by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane, who had been using Falcone to import a dangerous hallucinogenic drug, synthesized from the odd blue flower Ducard had charge Bruce with retrieving in Bhutan, that causes severe psychosis. Crane exposes Falcone to the toxin while wearing a burlap mask, driving Falcone mad with fear of the \"Scarecrow.\" While investigating Crane, Batman is also exposed to the drug and is rescued by Alfred and given an antidote by Fox. Rachel goes to Arkham, where Crane reveals that he has been dumping the toxin into Gotham\\'s water supply before dosing her with it. She is rescued by Batman, who sprays Crane himself with the toxin and interrogates him. Crane reveals that he\\'s been working for Ra\\'s al Ghul, an epiphany that Batman finds impossible. Batman fights a SWAT team sent to capture him and escapes Arkham with Rachel, whose mind is fading quickly. In the Tumbler, Batman blasts through the police force sent to trap him. He takes Rachel to his lair, inoculates her and gives her two vials of the antidote, one for Sgt. Gordon and one for mass production. Back at Arkham, Gordon and his investigative team find that Crane\\'s men have been dumping the toxin into the city\\'s water supply for weeks, however it hasn\\'t affected the population yet because it needs to be inhaled to take effect.\\n\\nAt his 30th birthday celebration at Wayne Manor, Bruce is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra\\'s Al Ghul. Bruce fakes a drunken tirade to get rid of his guests, leaving him alone with Ra\\'s and his ninjas. Ra\\'s reveals the League\\'s plan to destroy Gotham: having stolen the Microwave Emitter and conspired with Crane, they intend to vaporize the city\\'s toxin-riddled water supply, creating mass hysteria and violence. The League sets fire to the mansion and Bruce is nearly trapped inside but is saved by Alfred.\\n\\nAs the League begins unleashing the toxin they also release dozens of Arkham\\'s most dangerous inmates. Batman rescues Rachel from a toxin-induced mob and reveals his true identity to her. He entrusts Sgt. Gordon with the Tumbler and pursues Ra\\'s, who is using Gotham\\'s train system to deliver the weapon throughout the city. Batman confronts Ra\\'s on the train and escapes just as Gordon uses the new Batmobile to destroy the elevated tracks, leaving Ra\\'s to die in the ensuing crash.\\n\\nBatman becomes a public hero, but simultaneously loses Rachel, who cannot bring herself to love both Bruce and Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly-traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Jim Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant. He shows Batman the new Bat-Signal and mentions a new costumed criminal who leaves Joker cards at crime scenes.

However, Westley is presumed dead after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\\n\\nFive years later, Buttercup is forcibly betrothed to Florin\\'s Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a small Sicilian man named Vizzini, a giant from Greenland named Fezzik, and a Spanish fencing master named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who murdered his father. A masked man in black pursues them, as does Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers.\\n\\nAtop the Cliffs of Insanity, the man in black defeats Inigo in a fencing duel and knocks him out, chokes Fezzik into unconsciousness, and tricks Vizzini into drinking a deadly poison. He forcibly flees with Buttercup. Buttercup correctly guesses he is the Dread Pirate Roberts, rebukes him for killing Westley, and shoves him into a gorge. While tumbling down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing the man is Westley, Buttercup throws herself into the gorge after him, and they are reunited.\\n\\nWhile making their way through the Fire Swamp to avoid Humperdinck and his soldiers, Westley explains that \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" is a transferable title that he assumed when the previous Roberts retired. Having found Buttercup, Westley intends to retire himself and pass on the title to someone else. Humperdinck captures the pair after they emerge from the Fire Swamp. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck after he promises to release Westley. Humperdinck secretly orders Count Rugen to take Westley to his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair. After Westley notices that Rugen has six fingers on his right hand, Rugen knocks him out.\\n\\nWhen Buttercup threatens to fatally stab herself if the wedding happens, Humperdinck falsely promises to find Westley for her. His real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing Guilder for it.

Enraged, Humperdinck imprisons Buttercup and tortures Westley to near death. Inigo and Fezzik, who followed Westley\\'s screams through the forest, find his body and bring him to Miracle Max, a folk healer who Humperdinck recently fired. The \"mostly dead\" Westley is revived by Max, though he is severely weakened.\\n\\nAs Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik storm the castle, Humperdinck panics and orders the in-progress wedding ceremony to be shortened. Inigo tracks down Rugen, who taunts him about his father\\'s death. Despite his injuries, Inigo eventually kills Rugen. Westley locates Buttercup, who believes she is married to Humperdinck and is about to commit suicide. Westley assures her the marriage is invalid because she never completed her wedding vows. Humperdinck finds them, and challenges Westley to a duel, but Westley stands and intimidates Humperdinck into surrendering. Inigo finds Westley and Buttercup, and Fezzik procures four horses for their escape. Having killed Rugen, Inigo is unsure what to do with his life; Westley offers him the Dread Pirate Roberts title.

Tom\\'s friend and co-worker McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which Tom asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer kisses Tom in the office. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer.\\n\\nTom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, a park bench which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, both Tom\\'s friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel (Chloë Grace Moretz) push him to question Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but that his demand that she promises to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make.\\n\\nOn day 290, they are hanging out in a cafe. Tom wants to go back to Summer\\'s place, but she insists on seeing The Graduate and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he\\'d always thought it was a romantic fairy tale.

Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn\\'t been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Tom is horrified and begins to sink into depression.\\n\\nSummer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom\\'s boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison (Rachel Boston).

After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that his depression is being worsened by the fact that he is only looking back on the positive aspects of their relationship.\\n\\nOne day he suddenly finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk.

He encounters performers led by Toulouse-Lautrec; his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \"Spectacular Spectacular\", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \"Diamond Dog Dancers\" perform for the audience (Lady Marmalade/Zidler\\'s Rap (Can Can)/Smells Like Teen Spirit). Toulouse-Lautrec arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth, a potential investor in the cabaret (\"Sparkling Diamonds\" medley). Early in the movie, it is made obvious that Satine suffers from tuberculosis.\\n\\nSatine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him in order to discuss things \"privately\" (Rhythm of the Night) but soon learns that he is just a writer; by this time Christian has fallen in love with her (\"Your Song\"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing the lines for the Moulin Rouge\\'s new show, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". With the help of Zidler, Toulouse-Lautrec and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil maharajah attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who is in love with a poor sitar player (\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\").\\n\\nThe Duke agrees to back the show on the condition that only he is allowed to see Satine. Meanwhile, Satine contemplates on Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become \"a real actress\" (One Day I\\'ll Fly Away). Christian later goes back to Satine to convince her that she loves him (\"Elephant Love Medley\"). As the cabaret is converted to a theater, Christian and Satine continue seeing each other under the pretense of rehearsing Satine\\'s lines.\\n\\nThe Duke becomes jealous and warns Zidler that he may stop financing the show; Zidler arranges for Satine to dine with the Duke that evening, but during practice she falls ill (Gorecki). That night, Zidler makes excuses to the Duke, claiming that Satine has gone to confession (\"Like a Virgin\"). Zidler learns that Satine\\'s tuberculosis has worsened, and that she does not have long to live. Satine tries to convince Christian that their relationship endangers the show, but he counters by writing a secret love song into the show to affirm their love (\"Come What May\").\\n\\nAs the Duke watches Christian rehearse lines with Satine, Nini, a jealous performer, points out that the play is a metaphor for Christian, Satine and the Duke. Enraged, the Duke demands that the play ending be changed so that the courtesan ends up with the Maharajah.\\n\\nSatine offers to spend the night with the Duke to keep the original ending. While at the Duke\\'s quarters, Satine sees Christian on the streets below, and realizes she cannot go through with this (\"El Tango De Roxanne\").

Zidler reiterates this warning to Satine, but when she refuses to return, he finally informs her that she is dying (A Fool to Believe). Acting on the threat to Christian\\'s life, Satine tells Christian they can no longer see each other as she will be staying with the Duke (The Show Must Go On). Christian tries following her, but is denied entry to the Moulin Rouge, and falls into a deep depression, even though Toulouse-Lautrec insists that Satine loves him.\\n\\nOn the night of the show, Christian sneaks into the Moulin Rouge, ready to pay Satine to return his love just as the Duke has paid for her (Hindi Sad Diamonds). He catches Satine before she steps on stage, and he demands she tells him that she does not love him. Suddenly they find themselves in the spotlight; Zidler convinces the audience that Christian is the disguised sitar player. Christian angrily denounces Satine and walks off the stage. From the rafters, Toulouse-Lautrec, cries out, \"The greatest thing you\\'ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return\", spurring Satine to sing the secret love song Christian wrote to express their love.\\n\\nChristian returns to the stage, joining her in the song. The Duke\\'s bodyguard tries to kill Christian, but is thwarted by Toulouse-Lautrec and La Petite Princesse (a dancer in the Moulin Rouge), while the Duke\\'s own attempt is stopped by Zidler.

Lieutenant Norrington\\'s (Jack Davenport) crew recovers a shipwrecked survivor, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Elizabeth takes a gold medallion from around Will\\'s neck before seeing a ship with black sails.\\n\\nEight years later in Port Royal, Jamaica, Norrington is promoted to commodore and proposes to Elizabeth at Fort Charles. Elizabeth\\'s tight corset makes her faint and fall into the water below, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. The Port Royal has 2 ships with the Royal Navy, The Dauntless and The Interceptor. The Interceptor is considered to be the fastest ship in the navy, second only to the cursed Black Pearl, a ship rumored to be with black sails and captained by a man so evil, that hell itself spat him back out. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who initially arrived to \"commandeer\" a ship (and was nearby inspecting the Interceptor when Elizabeth falls over), jumps into the water and rescues Elizabeth (and sees the gold medallion around her neck) before escaping Commodore Norrington, who identifies Jack with his pirate brand. Will, now a blacksmith, meets Jack inside his shop where Jack enters to remove his chains. Will fights Jack long enough for Sparrow to be imprisoned. Elizabeth and Will are friends.\\n\\nThat night, Port Royal is attacked by the Black Pearl, the ship Elizabeth saw years earlier, searching for the medallion. Black Pearl sprays the port with cannon fire before the pirates enter the town in search of the medallion, when the town is in chaos. The pirates led by Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) reach Elizabeth\\'s mansion to take the medallion. Invoking parley (The term written as \"parlay\" on the Pirata Codex was known as a right in the Code of the Pirate Brethren, set down by Morgan and Bartholomew, that allowed any person to invoke temporary protection and brought before the captain to \"negotiate\" without being attacked until the parley is complete), Elizabeth is taken aboard to meet Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth negotiates that Barbossa stop firing on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. Although she gives her name as \"Elizabeth Turner\" to conceal her identity as the governor\\'s daughter, Barbossa takes Elizabeth with them upon hearing the name \"Turner\".\\n\\nBarbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 Aztec gold pieces in a stone chest used to bribe Cortes to stop his slaughter, but because of Cortes\\'s greed, the heathen Gods placed a curse on the gold. Any man who spent even a single piece of this gold would be punished for eternity. Barbossa\\'s crew found the treasure at Isla De Muerta, but after spending it, they feel and taste nothing, and turn into immortal Undead skeletons in the moonlight. To lift the curse, Barbossa\\'s crew must return all the gold with their blood. Having discovered that \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner sent a piece to his child, Barbossa sent Bootstrap to the bottom of the ocean. Assuming Elizabeth is Bootstrap\\'s child, Barbossa intends to use her blood instead.\\n\\nWill wants Norrington to find Elizabeth, and take Jack\\'s help, but Norrington refuses to deal with pirates. To save Elizabeth, Will frees Jack, who learns that Turner is the son of Bootstrap Bill. Jack agrees to take Will to the Black Pearl and to Elizabeth. Jack says that the Black Pearl berths at Isla De Muerta. They distract Norrington with a staged attempt to steal the Dauntless, allowing them to commandeer the HMS Interceptor. Jack says that Will\\'s father Bootstrap Bill was a pirate, which dismays Will. They head to Tortuga to find Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally) and recruit a crew. Gibbs agrees to join Jack when he learns that Will is the only living son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. Will learns from Gibbs that Sparrow was captain of the Black Pearl before Barbossa organized a mutiny and marooned him on an island. Jack was given a pistol with one bullet in it. Despite going mad with heat, Jack saved the shot for Barbossa. He escaped the island by roping together sea turtles and making a raft.\\n\\nArriving at Isla De Muerta, Jack and Will sneak into the treasure grotto, where Barbossa fails to lift the curse with Elizabeth\\'s \"Turner\" blood. Barbossa is livid since the pirates have waited for 10 years to repay the terms of the curse. Barbossa wants Elizabeth to reveal who is the real child of Bill Turner. As the pirate crew bicker among each other, Will and Elizabeth escape with the medallion on the Interceptor, while Sparrow is captured by Barbossa and locked in the brig aboard the Pearl, when Jack says that he knows the identity of the real Turner child.\\n\\nA battle ensues between the Pearl and the Interceptor, with the crew captured and the ship destroyed. Having realized it is his blood Barbossa needs, Will surrenders himself to ensure Elizabeth\\'s freedom. Barbossa agrees but maroons Jack and Elizabeth on an Island. It is the same island where Jack was marooned before by Barbossa. Jack reveals that run runners used the island as a base to store their rum, and Jack was able to barter a passage with them after waiting for only 3 days. But now, the rum runners are out of business due to Norrington. The next morning, Elizabeth makes a smoke signal, then Jack and Elizabeth are rescued aboard the Dauntless. Elizabeth accepts Norrington\\'s marriage proposal on the condition to rescue Will from Barbossa.\\n\\nThat night, Jack and Norrington make a plan to ambush the pirates at Isla De Muerta, but Norrington plans to ambush the pirates himself and Sparrow convinces Barbossa to not lift the curse until after they\\'ve killed Norrington\\'s men. Having anticipated the battle to come, Jack secretly palms a coin for himself to become immortal, then frees Will and duels Barbossa in the cave. As Norrington\\'s crew battle skeletons aboard the Dauntless, Elizabeth sneaks off to free Jack\\'s crew, who flee on the Pearl, leaving Swann to save Will and Jack by herself. After Elizabeth helps defeat some of Barbossa\\'s crewmen, Sparrow shoots Barbossa just as Will returns both remaining coins with their blood into the chest, lifting the curse.

He warns them about the \"Careers\" from Districts 1 and 2 who have trained intensively at special academies for the Games and who almost always win. He also says that minor objects in the game can mean the difference between life and death. Objects like food, water, fire can only be provided by sponsors & to get sponsors you need to get people to like you.\\n\\nThere is a 2-week training & evaluation period where sponsors get to see the tribute\\'s skills. Katniss is a strong and smart competitor & gathers sponsor attention by shooting an apple in their buffet, during evaluation. She gets a high score. President Snow tells Gamemaker Seneca Crane to contain Katniss, lest she controls the games. During an interview with TV personality Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss. She is initially outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as \"sponsors\" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine, and tools. However, she discovers Peeta meant what he said.\\n\\nThe Games begin with half of the tributes killed in the first few minutes; Katniss barely survives ignoring Haymitch\\'s advice to run away from the melee around the tempting supplies and weapons strewn in front of a structure called the Cornucopia. Peeta forms an uneasy alliance with the Careers Cato, Clove, Marvel and Glimmer, and aids in the killing of the District 8 female tribute. Katniss tries to hide in the edges of the game & Crane pushes her back in by setting fire to the forest. Katniss is injured while escaping the raging flames. Haymitch convinces some sponsors to send some antibiotics to Katniss in the game to keep her alive.\\n\\nThe Careers later find Katniss and chase her up a tree. A young girl from District 11 named Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, draws her attention to a poisonous Tracker Jaccker nest hanging from a branch. Katniss drops it on her sleeping besiegers. They all scatter, except for Glimmer, who is killed by the insects. Hallucinating due to Tracker Jacker venom, Katniss is warned to run away by Peeta. Rue cares for Katniss for a couple of days until she recovers.\\n\\nThe alliance has gathered all the supplies into a pile. Katniss has Rue draw them off, then destroys the stockpile by setting off the mines the group had planted around it. Furious, Cato kills the District 3 boy assigned to guard it. Rue is fatally wounded by Marvel. Katniss kills Marvel, then comforts the dying Rue. Afterward, she gathers and arranges flowers around Rue\\'s body. When this is televised, it sparks a riot in District 11. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) summons Seneca Crane, the Gamemaker, to express his displeasure at the way the Games are turning out.\\n\\nSince Katniss and Peeta have been presented to the public as \"star-crossed lovers\", Haymitch is able to convince Crane to make a rule change to avoid inciting further riots. It is announced that tributes from the same district can win as a pair. Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him with an infected sword wound in the leg. She portrays herself as deeply in love with him and gains the sponsor gift of soup. An announcer proclaims a feast, where the thing each survivor needs most will be provided. Peeta begs her not to risk getting him medicine.\\n\\nKatniss promises not to go, but after he falls asleep, she heads to the feast. Clove ambushes her and pins her down.

The medicine works, keeping Peeta mobile.\\n\\nFoxface, the girl from District 5, who had survived by avoiding human contact, and stealing food from other tributes, dies from eating Nightlock berries she had stolen from Peeta; neither knowing they are highly poisonous. Crane unleashes a pack of hound-like creatures, called Mutations, to speed things up. They kill Thresh and force Katniss and Peeta to flee to the roof of the Cornucopia, where they encounter Cato. After a battle, Katniss wounds Cato with an arrow and Peeta hurls him to the creatures below. Katniss shoots Cato to spare him a prolonged death.\\n\\nWith Peeta and Katniss apparently victorious, the rule change allowing two winners is suddenly revoked, forcing Peeta and Katniss to fight to the death. Peeta tells Katniss to shoot him. Instead, she gives him half of the Nightlock, realizing that killing themselves would deprive the people of a victor. However, before they can commit suicide, they are hastily proclaimed the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.\\n\\nHaymitch warns Katniss that she has made powerful enemies after her display of defiance.

Nicknamed Scout, the narrator, who is six years old at the beginning of the book, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. They also have a black cook, Calpurnia, who has been with the family for many years and helps Atticus raise the two children.\\n\\nJem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated, by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and many of them have not seen him for many years. The children feed one another\\'s imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.\\n\\nJudge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb\\'s citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus\\'s actions, calling him a \"nigger-lover\". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father\\'s honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks the mob mentality by recognizing and talking to a classmate\\'s father, causing the would-be lynchers to disperse.\\n\\nAtticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson\\'s trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes, the pastor of Calpurnia\\'s church, invites Jem, Scout and Dill to watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying. It is revealed that Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as \"white trash\" who are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem\\'s faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.\\n\\nDespite Tom\\'s conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial. Atticus explains that he destroyed Ewell\\'s last shred of credibility. Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus\\' face, trying to break into the judge\\'s house and menacing Tom Robinson\\'s widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after a school pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm and is knocked unconscious in the struggle, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children\\'s rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.\\n\\nSheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff tells Atticus that, to protect Boo\\'s privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home.

Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, shape-shifting prototype Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect John, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living tissue.\\n\\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John\\'s mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators\\' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, also considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John\\'s aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces that the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it to kill people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000.\\n\\nThe T-800 and John intercept Sarah as she is making an escape attempt, but Sarah flees in horror upon seeing that the T-800 looks identical to the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984.[b] John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet\\'s creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like.\\n\\nSarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson. She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot bring herself to kill a person and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals that his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing that his work must be destroyed, Dyson helps Sarah, John, and the T-800 break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill.\\n\\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah\\'s appearance and voice to lure out John, but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. John also throws the 1984 Terminator\\'s arm and CPU into the vat. The T-800 explains that it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John\\'s tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him that its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah, having come to respect the T-800, shakes its hand and lowers it into the vat. The T-800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing that if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\\n\\nThus, John Connor fulfilled the prophecy of leading a resistance (himself, mother, Dyson, and T-800) against the Machines (the polymorphic T-1000), destroying Skynet (i.e., Cyberdyne Systems), and preserving humanity\\'s future in the process.'}]},\n"," {'name': 'Caregiver / Healer',\n","  'description': 'Provides nurture, comfort, or medical/spiritual healing; supports others’ well-being and stability.',\n","  'examples': [{'author': 'andrei'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Dr. Ellen Ripley',\n","    'movie_name': 'Aliens',\n","    'summary': \"Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years. She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship, the Nostromo; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship. Ripley tries to convince her employers that while she killed the creature, the alien ship itself carried thousands of eggs & if any of those were to make their way to Earth, life would come to an end as these aliens gestate inside living humans.\\n\\nIn Zeta Reticuli, the Exomoon LV-426, where the USCSS Nostromo encountered the alien eggs, is now home to the Terraforming colony Hadley's Hope with about 60 - 70 families living there for over 20 years to change the planet's atmosphere and make it livable for humans. One of the exploration groups at the station encounters the alien ship & accidentally triggers the breeding process in which one of the eggs hatches and locks itself to the face of the explorer, starting the breeding.\\n\\nWhen contact is lost with Hadley's Hope, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature; she makes Burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the Aliens. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the Colonial Marines and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo.\\n\\nA drop-ship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live face-Huggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a survivor, a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt (Carrie Henn) who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in Alien secretions.\\n\\nAt the center of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the Aliens' offspring. When the marines kill a newborn Alien, the Aliens are roused and ambush the marines, killing and capturing several. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley takes control of their vehicle and rams it through the nest to rescue marines Hicks (Michael Biehn), Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Hicks orders the drop-ship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway Alien kills the pilots, causing it to crash. Ripley, Newt, Burke and the remaining marines barricade themselves inside the colony.\\n\\nRipley discovers that Burke deliberately sent the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering Alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: the power plant was damaged during the battle and will soon detonate with the force of a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco's remaining drop-ship to the surface.\\n\\nRipley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two face-Huggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the face-Huggers so that they would impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hyper-sleep during the return trip so that no one could contradict his version of events. Before the marines can kill Burke, the electricity is cut and Aliens assault through the ceiling. Vasquez and Gorman are killed, while Hudson, Burke, and Newt are captured.\\n\\nRipley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop in the second drop-ship, but Ripley refuses to abandon Newt. She hastily assembles a weapon and rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen in her egg chamber. Ripley destroys the eggs, enraging the queen, who tears free from her Ovipositor. Pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the drop-ship. All four escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast.\\n\\nOn the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the drop-ship's landing gear, tears Bishop in two. The queen advances on Newt, but Ripley clashes with her using an Exosuit cargo-loader and expels it through an airlock.

Deagol is dragged into the river by a powerful catch and discovers the One Ring glinting in the riverbed. He collects it and climbs out of the river. Smeagol sees him fondling it and as they both succumb to the Ring\\'s power they begin to quarrel. Smeagol demands it saying that it\\'s his birthday and it should be his present. The squabble turns into a fight and Smeagol strangles his friend with his bare hands to finally remove the Ring from his clenched fist. We are then shown how Smeagol was ostracized from his community and driven away. Suffering terribly from his loneliness and shame, Smeagol takes solace in his love for the Ring as it slowly tortures his mind. His hardships in the Mountains twist his shape into that of Gollum.\\n\\nAs the flashback ends, we are taken back to the present where, on the outskirts of Mordor, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are resting in an alcove. Sam awakes and sees that his master has not slept, the days are also growing darker the closer they get to Minas Morgul and Mordor. Gollum arrives and urges them to move on. Away in the west, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Eomer (Karl Urban) are riding through Fangorn to Isengard, where they meet Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) feasting among the wreckage of Isengard. They then go and see Treebeard at the Orthanc where Saruman (Christopher Lee) has been trapped. Gandalf opposes Gimli\\'s call to kill Saruman, saying that the wizard has no power anymore and will pose no further threat. As they are talking, Pippin sees the Palantir among the flotsam and is enamored by it, but Gandalf quickly asks it from him and hides in under his cloak.\\n\\nThe group then rides to Edoras, where King Theoden has prepared a feast to \\'hail the victorious dead\\' of the Battle of the Hornburg. There Éowyn (Miranda Otto) shows affection for Aragorn which Theoden notices, he tells her that he is happy for her, Aragorn being an honorable man and the architect of the victory at Helm\\'s Deep. Gandalf also expresses to Aragorn his concerns over the quest, Aragorn tells him to trust in what his heart tells him, that Frodo is still alive.\\n\\nGollum awakes in the night as Frodo and Sam are sleeping and goes off to one side to murmur to himself. His evil half senses some doubt in Smeagol and insists that if he can murder once (referring to Deagol) he can do it again. Gollum then begins leading Smeagol through their plan, to deliver the hobbits into the clutches of Shelob in Cirith Ungol, after which the Ring can be reclaimed. Sam hears this and proceeds to beat Gollum for his treachery, Frodo intervenes, saying that as their guide Gollum is necessary for their quest. Sam obliges as Gollum flashes him an evil smile while Frodo\\'s back is turned.\\n\\nThat same night back in Edoras, Pippin\\'s curiosity gets the better of him; relieving Gandalf of the Palantir, he looks into it. Pippin sees a vision of a white tree in a stone courtyard set ablaze, but in doing so he is caught by Sauron and submitted to mental torture and questioning. Aragorn tries to rescue him and thus briefly exposes himself to Sauron. Pippin recovers from his ordeal, and it is discovered that he did not tell Sauron anything of the Ring\\'s whereabouts. From Pippin\\'s vision of the White Tree, Gandalf deduces that Sauron is now moving to attack Minas Tirith and he rides off to send warning, taking Pippin with him, lest his urge to look upon the Palantir (left now in Aragorn\\'s keeping) return again.\\n\\nLeaving Rivendell on her way to the Undying Lands, Arwen (Liv Tyler) has a vision of her son by Aragorn, she realizes that her father lied to her about there being no chance of a future with him whom she loves. She returns to Rivendell and convinces Elrond that she, having forsaken the life of the Eldar, cannot leave Aragorn now. She tells her father that as was declared in lore, the time to reforge Narsil has come, Narsil being the sword of Elendil that cut the Ring from Sauron\\'s finger long ago at the end of the Second Age.\\n\\nGandalf and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith, City of Kings, that was built out of the rock of Mindolluin. There Pippin recognizes the White Tree as they go to find the Steward Denethor (John Noble). They approach him mourning over Boromir (Sean Bean), his son. Pippin swears loyalty to him in recompense for Boromir\\'s sacrifice. Denethor seems to be caught up in his grief and has not taken measures to fortify the city against the threat of Sauron.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Frodo, Sam and Gollum arrive at Minas Morgul. Wary of the enemy, they locate the Winding Stair (leading to the pass of Cirith Ungol) that lies hidden in the cliffs surrounding the accursed city. Just at that moment, the doors of the city open and the Witch-king of Angmar (Lawrence Makoare), leader of the Nazgul, dispatches his immense Orc army from his lair, heralding the start of the war. This is witnessed by Gandalf and Pippin as a flash of lightning shoots up at the opening of the doors. At the urging of Gandalf, Pippin lights the first of the beacon signals to Edoras, alerting Theoden, Aragorn and the rest of the Rohirrim to ride to the weapon-take at Dunharrow and thence to Minas Tirith. As they leave Edoras, Aragorn notices that Eowyn saddles up with them and that she is girt with a sword, but she insists that she rides only to see them off and that the men have found their captain in Aragorn.\\n\\nThe Morgul army crosses Anduin at Osgiliath in makeshift boats and engages the Gondorian contingent (lead by Faramir (David Wenham)) in battle. The orcs prove too strong and drive the Gondorians out of Osgiliath, Faramir and his few surviving men retreat to Minas Tirith, pursued by the Nazgul. Gandalf, riding out to meet the retreating men, wards them off, saving Faramir. Upon his arrival, Faramir tells Gandalf of the dangerous route Gollum is taking Frodo and Sam on, convincing Gandalf of Gollum\\'s treachery. The hobbits, led by Gollum, are struggling to climb the extremely steep stairs, Gollum reaches out and empathizes with Frodo, saying that he understands his pain, and also poisoning him against Sam, saying that he will try and take the Ring from Frodo.\\n\\nIn the captured Osgiliath, the Witch-king orders his captain to \"send forth all legions\" and annihilate the population of Minas Tirith, saying that he himself will \"break\" the wizard Gandalf. Denethor, ill-pleased by Faramir\\'s defense of Osgiliath, manipulates him into taking a doomed ride to reclaim the city. Gollum continues to play the hobbits against each other, this time by blaming Sam for eating their food provisions. Frodo, in his deluded state, is suspicious of Sam and orders him back home when Sam, trying to be helpful, offers to carry the Ring, thereby fulfilling Gollum\\'s cunning prediction. Faramir rides head-long into the arrows of the encamped orcs as Pippin sings for Denethor who unconcernedly eats his noon-meal.\\n\\nThe attack is destroyed and Faramir is dragged back by his horse in a death-like coma. At the weapon-take of Dunharrow, a hooded figure slowly rides on a white horse along the winding road to the encampment in the hills. The figure reveals himself to Aragorn as Elrond (Hugo Weaving). He presents Aragorn with his birthright - the newly forged Anduril, Flame of the West. He urges Aragorn to use this sword, forged from the shards of Narsil, to recall the Dead Men of Dunharrow and use their allegiance to the heir of Isildur (i.e. Aragorn) to stop the attack of the Corsairs ships from the south. Aragorn accepts this counsel and rides off that very night into the Dimholt, along with Legolas and Gimli. As he is preparing to go, a tearful Eowyn comes to Aragorn and begs him not to go, declaring her love for him, but Aragorn, knowing now that Arwen has refused promise of Valinor, likewise refuses Eowyn\\'s love. The next morning, Theoden rides off to war with six thousand riders, unaware that Eowyn and Merry, who were both told to remain behind by the King, are also part of his army.\\n\\nThe Morgul forces, composed mostly of Orcs, begin the siege of Minas Tirith using the heads of captured prisoners as catapult projectiles. Denethor sees his son and believes him to be dead, he also beholds the might of the forces marshaled against him and at this he loses control and hope, ordering the Gondorians to abandon their positions. Gandalf however, steps in and incapacitates Denethor, and then proceeds to assume control of the defense. A skirmish between Gondorian Trebuchets and Mordor catapults ensues until the Witch-king and the other Ringwraiths on their Fell Beasts attack, destroying the catapults and sowing terror among the defenders.\\n\\nAway in Cirith Ungol, Gollum betrays Frodo to the spider-creature Shelob, but Sam returns to fight her off. Sam believes Frodo is dead, but when Orcs from the Tower of Cirith Ungol come and investigate, Sam overhears that Frodo has only been paralyzed by Shelob\\'s stinger.\\n\\nIn Minas Tirith, Denethor, stricken mad over his grief at having spent both his sons, prepares a funeral pyre for himself and the unconscious Faramir, unaware that the pyre will burn him alive. Gandalf and Pippin arrive in the Hallows and manage to save Faramir, but Denethor is thrown onto the pyre and as he burns to his death, he turns and sees his son stirring awake from his injuries and exhaustion. Down in the city, the battle goes ill with the Gondorians, as Grond shatters through the gates of the city and trolls pour in. The defenders retreat to the upper levels of the city, the orcs crawl all over the streets, looting, burning and massacring the men of Gondor. But suddenly in the midst of the chaos a lone horn penetrates the air and all turn to the west and see the army of Rohan arrive at last, to the rising of the sun. The Rohirrim charge into the Orcs with great effect. However, their joy is cut short by the arrival of the forces of Harad and the immense Mumakil. The Witch-king descends on Theoden, killing Snowmane his horse and fatally wounding the King. Seemingly in the nick of time, the Corsairs ships arrive to help the stranded Orcs, but it is Aragorn who jumps off the ship followed by the Undead Army, and they completely destroy the Orcs and Mumakil, while Eowyn and Merry kill the Witch-king. Théoden dies of his wounds and Aragorn holds the Dead Army\\'s oath fulfilled, releasing them from their curse so that they may rest in peace.\\n\\nSam rescues Frodo from Cirith Ungol, which is mostly empty following a fight between the two factions of the Tower\\'s Orc garrison over Frodo\\'s Mithril shirt, and they begin the long trek across Mordor to Mount Doom. Gandalf realizes that ten thousand Orcs stand between Cirith Ungol and Mount Doom, which will prevent Frodo from reaching his destination. Aragorn proposes they lead the remaining soldiers to the Black Gate to draw the Orcs away from Frodo\\'s path, as well as distract the Eye of Sauron. Sam carries Frodo up to Mount Doom, but Gollum arrives and attacks them, just as the Battle of the Morannon begins.\\n\\nAt the Crack of Doom, Frodo, instead of dropping the ring into the Fire, succumbs to its power and puts it on, disappearing from sight (the act alerts Sauron, and sends the Ringwraiths racing towards Mount Doom). Gollum renders Sam unconscious then attacks Frodo, seizing his ring finger and biting it off. As Gollum rejoices at finally having reclaimed his Precious, Frodo, still under the sway of the Ring\\'s attraction, charges at Gollum. After a brief struggle, they both fall over the edge of the precipice. Gollum falls into the Fire with the Ring, while Frodo barely hangs on with his strength failing. Sam rescues Frodo as the Ring finally sinks into the lava and is destroyed. The Tower of Barad-Dur collapses, Sauron\\'s essence fades and then explodes, forever banishing his power. The Orcs, Ringwraiths and the remaining forces of Sauron are consumed in the ensuing shock-wave as the earth collapses under their feet. Frodo and Sam are stranded as Mount Doom erupts. They voice their regrets at not being able to see the Shire again in the middle of the torrents of lava and the destruction of Barad-Dur. With the destruction of the Nazgul, Gandalf is able to call upon the Eagles to carry the hobbits to safety, they awake in Minas Tirith, reuniting with the other members of the fellowship, all of them having survived the War of the Ring.\\n\\nAragorn is crowned King of the West, heralding the new age of peace, and is reunited with Arwen. The hobbits return to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Frodo, having finished writing his entry in the Red Book of Westmarch, is still suffering from the effects of the ring, having possessed it for so long. He realizes that he will never have peace in Middle-earth. So, he decides to go with Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond and Galadriel to the Grey Havens. There he passes the Red Book onto Sam to record the years of his life to come, and thence the last ship to leave Middle-earth sets off, pulling slowly away from the shore and passing along the Straight Road into the Uttermost West. Pippin and Merry take their leave and Sam is left staring into the golden sunset.\\n\\nIn the last scene, Sam is shown walking back up the lane to Bag End, where he is greeted by Rosie his wife and his children, surrounded by his family and with the rest of his life ahead of him, Sam sighs and says \"Well, I\\'m back\", then he goes inside and shuts the door as the screen fades to black.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Other'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Molly Weasley',\n","    'movie_name': 'Harry Potter series',\n","    'summary': \"The Harry Potter series, written by J.K.

Flashback to 1935, where Paul works with fellow guards Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn), Bill Dodge (Brent Briscoe) and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper). The death row is usually called the \"The Last Mile\", but at Cold Mountain, it was called \"The Green Mile\" as the floor was the color of faded limes. The electric chair was named \"The Old Sparky\". 1935 was the worst year for Paul as he had a urinary infection. It was a painful infection and Paul felt that every time he went to urinate, he was passing razor-blades.\\n\\nPercy Wetmore, a sadist with a fierce temper, has recently begun working in the death row inmates block; his fellow guards dislike him, but cannot get rid of him because of his family connections to the governor.\\n\\nOne day, John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan), a giant African American man convicted of sexually assaulting and killing two young white girls, arrives on death row. However, he is shy, soft-spoken, and emotional. Other inmates are Eduard, Wharton, Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene), Toot-Toot (Harry Dean Stanton) and others. Percy (Doug Hutchison) is a sadist man & a guard in Paul\\'s block. Percy takes unique pleasure in pointing out that a person is on death row and would taunt them continuously to remind them of this fact, trying to provoke them into a fight. Paul tries to control Percy, to no avail.\\n\\nIn his conviction sheet, it is noted that 2 girls went missing from a Louisiana home. The father Klaus (William Sadler) and the neighbors launch a manhunt and find John some distance away, inside the jungle, with the bloodied bodies of his 2 daughters. It is indicated that John can sense a person\\'s history by making physical contact with them. It is also indicated that John was in pain, and was yelling, as he was traumatized by what happened to the 2 girls (he was stroking their hair, as he lay on the ground weeping and yelling). John only says that he tried to take it back, but it was too late, indicating that he sexually assaulted the girls and killed them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a violent prisoner named \"Wild Bill\" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) has arrived, to be executed for multiple murders committed during a robbery. Wharton has been a problem child all along and appears to be mentally ill. Yet, he has been declared mentally competent, and hence is now on death row.\\n\\nPaul is married to Jan (Bonnie Hunt). Brutus and Dean discover a mouse in the cell block, who hides in the storage room. But when the storage room is searched, there is no sign of it. The mouse is cute and was a source of entertainment for the inmates & Paul & his team. The mouse befriends Eduard, who names him Mr. Jingles. Eduard takes Mr Jingles for a pet. When Percy gets to know about this, Percy decides to kill it precisely because it brought Joy to other people\\'s lives. Percy tries hard to find the mouse inside the storage cell, without luck. Mr Jingles gets very famous and even politicians visit the prison to see him perform. One day, while Percy was razzing on Eduard, Wharton got hold of Percy and threatened to kill him. Percy got so scared that he urinated in his pants. Eduard could not stop laughing about this, and Percy felt humiliated. Percy swears revenge on Eduard. As Eduard is on death row, he asks Paul to take care of Mr Jingles while he is gone. But just then, as Mr Jingles escapes Eduard\\'s cell, Percy steps on it and kills it.\\n\\nJohn reveals extraordinary powers by healing Paul\\'s urinary tract infection and resurrecting the mouse. Every time John \"heals\" someone, a swarm of insects fly out of his mouth, indicating the disease being expelled from his own body. Percy believes that Brutus and Paul switched the mouse.\\n\\nDuring his training Percy is taught never to throw the electric switch on the chair, without wetting the towel. Wetting the towel conducts the electricity smoothly to the brain and leads to a swift and painless death. Soon, the prison witnesses the death row of Arlen. It requires 2 sets of shocks to kill Arlen, when the first jolt fails to stop his heartbeat.\\n\\nPaul reaches out to John\\'s mental doctor Burt Hammersmith (Gary Sinise) to understand how a non-violent man like John could sexually assault and murder 2 girls. John had no prior official record of his existence (it was like he materialized out of nowhere). The doctor says that he has no doubt that John committed those crimes, but his judgment is severely impaired by his hatred for the African Americans (because his own boy was attacked by a dog and blinded in one eye. Burt compares African Americans to dogs).\\n\\nPercy demands to manage the execution of Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter), promising that afterward, he will transfer to an administrative post at the Briar Ridge mental hospital. An agreement is made, but Percy then deliberately sabotages the execution: Instead of wetting the sponge used to conduct electricity and make executions quick and effective, he leaves it dry, causing the execution to malfunction dramatically. Eduard literally fries in the chair and his flesh is cooked from within his body, and eventually catches fire.\\n\\nPaul\\'s warden Hal\\'s wife is suffering from a brain tumor and Hal is distraught. Paul convinces Hal to let Malinda meet John. Paul reveals to Hal about how John healed him. Paul then convinces his team to distract Percy, to John can be brought out of his cell block to meet Melinda. Percy is bound and gagged and put into solitary confinement, while Wharton is drugged and put to sleep. Later, John heals the terminally ill wife Melinda (Patricia Clarkson) (who has a brain tumor and it cannot be operated upon) of Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). When John is asked to explain his power, he merely says that he \"took it back.\" But this time, the insects don\\'t escape from John\\'s body, after he sucks Melinda\\'s disease from her body. Brutus knows that John swallowed Melinda\\'s sickness for a reason.\\n\\nAt one point Wharton seizes John\\'s arm, and John psychically senses that Wharton is also responsible for the crime for which John was convicted and sentenced to death. John \"takes back\" the sickness in Hal\\'s wife and regurgitates it into Percy, who then shoots Wharton to death and falls into a state of permanent catatonia. Percy is then admitted to Briar Ridge Mental Hospital as a patient rather than an administrator.\\n\\nIn the wake of these events, Paul interrogates John, who says he \"punished them bad men\" and offers to show Paul what he saw. John takes Paul\\'s hand and says he has to give Paul \"a part of himself\" in order for Paul to see what really happened to the girls. Paul realizes that it was Wharton who had killed the 2 little girls, after sexually assaulting them.\\n\\nPaul asks John what he should do, if he should open the door and let John walk away. John tells him that there is too much pain in the world, to which he is sensitive, and says he is \"rightly tired of the pain\" and is ready to rest. For his last request on the night before his execution, John watches the film Top Hat. When John is put in the electric chair, he asks Paul not to put the traditional black hood over his head because he is afraid of the dark. Paul agrees, shakes his hand, and John is executed.\\n\\nAs an elderly Paul finishes his story, he notes that he requested a transfer to a youth detention center, where he spent the remainder of his career. Elaine questions his statement that he had a fully grown son at the time, and Paul explains that he was 44 years old at the time of John\\'s execution and that he is now 108. This is apparently a side effect of John giving a \"part of himself\" to Paul. Mr. Jingles, Del\\'s mouse resurrected by John, is also still alive - but Paul believes his outliving all of his relatives and friends (including Elaine, who is shown to have died at the end) to be a punishment from God for having John executed and wonders how long it will be before his own death.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Other'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Dr. Adrian Levinson',\n","    'movie_name': 'Ordinary People',\n","    'summary': \"The Jarretts are an upper-middle-class family in Lake Forest, a wealthy suburb north of Chicago.

He feels alienated from his friends and family and seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone Berger, who discovers that Conrad was involved in the sailing accident that caused Buck's death. Conrad is now dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and is seeking help to cope with his emotions.\\n\\nConrad's father, Calvin, attempts to connect with his surviving son and understand his wife, while Conrad's mother, Beth, denies her loss, hoping to maintain her composure and restore her family to what it once was. She appears to have favored her older son and has grown cold toward Conrad due to his suicide attempt. Beth is determined to maintain the appearance of perfection and normality, and her efforts only serve to alienate Conrad further. Conrad works with Dr. Berger and begins to learn how to deal with his emotions rather than control them. He starts dating a fellow student, Jeannine, who helps him regain a sense of optimism. However, Conrad still struggles to communicate and establish normal relationships with his parents and schoolmates.\\n\\nBeth and Conrad often argue while Calvin tries to referee, generally taking Conrad's side for fear of pushing him over the edge again. Tensions escalate near Christmas when Conrad becomes furious at Beth for not wanting to take a photo with him, swearing at her in front of his grandparents. Afterwards, Beth discovers Conrad has been lying about his after-school whereabouts. This leads to a heated confrontation between Conrad and Beth in which Conrad points out that Beth never visited him in the hospital; Conrad argues that if Buck had been hospitalized in his place, she would have gone to see him, to which Beth curtly replies that Buck would never have been in the hospital in the first place. Beth and Calvin take a trip to see Beth's brother Ward in Houston, where Calvin presses Beth about her evasive attitude.\\n\\nConrad suffers a setback when he learns that Karen, a friend from the psychiatric hospital, has committed suicide. A cathartic breakthrough session in the middle of the night with Dr. Berger allows Conrad to stop blaming himself for Buck's death and accept his mother's frailties.

Mary transports the group into one of Bert\\'s drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary and Bert sing while strolling (\"Jolly Holiday\"). Bert and Mary then participate in a horse race, which Mary wins. Mary uses a nonsense word to describe her victory (\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"). When a thunderstorm dissolves Bert\\'s drawings, the group is returned to London. While putting the children to bed, Mary sings a lullaby (\"Stay Awake\").\\n\\nThe next day, the trio and Bert visit Mary\\'s odd uncle, Albert, whose uncontrollable laughter has caused him to float (\"I Love to Laugh\").

Upon awakening, Marlin discovers that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin vows to keep his only surviving child safe, calling him Nemo, a name Coral liked.\\n\\nMarlin becomes overprotective of his son; on Nemo\\'s first day at school, the two have a heated argument regarding Marlin\\'s parenting approach. Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin frantically pursues the boat in vain. Marlin meets Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers to help him. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver\\'s mask that fell from the boat and accidentally injures Dory with it. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines; the sharks, Marlin, and Dory are able to swim to safety before the mines blow up.\\n\\nNemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney. He meets the \"Tank Gang\", led by Gill, a scarred Moorish idol. Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who killed her previous pet fish as a result of her careless treatment. Gill, who also wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo, the smallest fish in the tank, will block the aquarium\\'s filter tube with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to block the filter but fails and is almost killed by the filter\\'s machinery, causing Gill to feel deeply regretful.\\n\\nThe diver\\'s mask falls into a deep trench.

The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel finds Marlin and Dory, and, after rescuing them from a flock of ravenous seagulls, takes them to Sherman\\'s office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla; this causes Marlin to believe Nemo is really dead.

When he tried to kill a 1 year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily and James Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry\\'s relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.\\n\\nShortly before Harry\\'s 11th birthday, he receives a letter. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry\\'s birthday), he is visited by Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous Wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron). Harry enters the Wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). He takes the train to Hogwarts from Platform Nine and three-quarters, befriending Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and meeting Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), a Muggle-born witch.\\n\\nUpon arrival, the Sorting Hat places Harry, Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor House. Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), an arrogant and elitist student, gets placed in Slytherin. At the end of their first week at Hogwarts, Harry and Ron discover that Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, was broken into and a vault that Harry and Hagrid visited had been the subject of the robbery. Later, Harry discovers he has a talent for riding broomsticks, and is recruited to join Gryffindor\\'s Quidditch team as a Seeker, much to Malfoy\\'s displeasure.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione explore Hogwarts late at night and accidentally stumble across the door to a corridor.

Javert leaves, confused by this act of mercy from a criminal whom he holds in low regard.\\n\\nWith the Parisians not joining the revolution as they expected, the students resolve to fight to the death. Everyone is killed except Marius, who is saved when Valjean drags his unconscious body into the sewers before the army arrives.

Thenardier show the way, and Valjean escapes the sewers carrying Marius, but is confronted by Javert. Valjean begs for one hour to take Marius to a doctor. Javert refuses and threatens to shoot him if he does not surrender. Valjean ignores him and leaves with Marius.

Smart and independent, she finds solace in books at the local library. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her in school, she puts peroxide in her father's hair tonic. After her father, Harry, berates her for criticizing his illegal car dealing activities, Matilda glues his hat to his head. After Harry destroys one of Matilda's library books and forces her to watch mindless television, Matilda becomes angry, and the television explodes.\\n\\nHarry sells a car to Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School, in exchange for admitting Matilda as a student. The other students warn Matilda about Trunchbull's abusive disciplinary methods, which include throwing students out the window and locking them in an iron maiden known as the Chokey. Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, notices the ease with which Matilda answers middle school multiplication questions and requests Matilda be moved to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. The Wormwoods are not interested either. Trunchbull has the whole school watch her force pupil Bruce Bogtrotter to eat an entire enormous chocolate cake as punishment for stealing a slice. Matilda leads the students in cheering Bruce to success, and Trunchbull gives them all five hours detention. Matilda discovers her father is under surveillance by the FBI over his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her warning, as Zinnia flirts with the two agents who pose as speedboat salesmen.\\n\\nDiscovering the car from Harry to be faulty, Trunchbull locks Matilda in the Chokey as punishment. Miss Honey rescues Matilda, and Matilda's friend Lavender puts a newt in Trunchbull's water jug. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, who angrily telekinetically tips the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Matilda is unable to reproduce her powers to Honey during a test. Honey invites Matilda to tea and reveals her past: her mother died when she was two, and her father Magnus invited his wife's stepsister, Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her. Magnus died, apparently by suicide, when Honey was five and left everything to Trunchbull in his will. Matilda and Honey sneak into Trunchbull's house to retrieve some of Honey's belongings. They narrowly escape when Trunchbull unexpectedly returns.\\n\\nMatilda practices her telekinetic powers and drives away the FBI agents. She returns to Trunchbull's house and wreaks havoc while posing as the vengeful spirit of Magnus, but Trunchbull uncovers Matilda's ruse upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Trunchbull visits the class and demands that Matilda confess. Matilda, again posing as Magnus' ghost, telekinetically writes a message on the blackboard. The message accuses Trunchbull of murdering him and demands that she return Miss Honey's house and money and leave town, threatening to murder her as retribution if she does not do so. Trunchbull is driven insane by the terror and attacks the students in a rage, but Matilda protects them and they force Trunchbull out.\\n\\nMiss Honey moves back into her house. Harry, Zinnia, and Michael come to take Matilda and flee to Guam to avoid the FBI. Matilda refuses to go, saying she would rather be adopted by Honey.

At a Halloween party, after Daniel sprays water on Johnny with a hose as payback, Johnny and his gang chase Daniel and brutally beat him until Miyagi suddenly intervenes and easily defeats them.\\n\\nAmazed, Daniel asks Miyagi to teach him karate. Although Miyagi declines, he agrees to accompany him to Cobra Kai to resolve the conflict. They meet the sensei, John Kreese, an ex-Special Forces Vietnam veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the upcoming Under 18 All-Valley Karate Championship tournament to compete against Kreese\\'s students on equal terms and requests that the bullying ceases while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will continue for both of them.\\n\\nDaniel\\'s training starts with days of menial chores that seemingly only serve to make him just a worker for Miyagi. When he becomes frustrated about it, Miyagi demonstrates that repetition of these chores has helped Daniel to learn defensive blocks through muscle memory.\\n\\nTheir bond develops, and Miyagi opens up to Daniel about his life, including the tragic loss of both his wife and son in childbirth at the Manzanar internment camp. Meanwhile he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe, where Miyagi received the Medal of Honor.\\n\\nThrough Miyagi\\'s teaching, Daniel learns both karate and essential life lessons, such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. He applies the life lessons Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali. On Daniel\\'s 18th birthday, Miyagi gives him a Karate gi for the tournament and one of his vintage cars.\\n\\nDaniel surprises the audience and competitors at the tournament by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against Darryl Vidal.

He reluctantly does so, momentarily crippling Daniel and getting himself disqualified.\\n\\nDaniel is taken to the locker room, where the physician determines that he cannot continue. However, Daniel believes that if he quits, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him, so he convinces Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to help him continue. Daniel returns to fight as Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default. The match is a seesaw battle, with neither able to break through the other\\'s defense.\\n\\nThe match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor-leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of his head and giving Johnny a nosebleed. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel\\'s injured leg – an unethical move. He looks horrified at the order but reluctantly agrees. As the match resumes and the score is tied 2–2, Johnny seizes Daniel\\'s leg and deals a vicious elbow, doing further damage.\\n\\nDaniel, standing with difficulty, assumes the \"Crane\" stance, a technique he learned observing Miyagi performing it on the beach.

As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem.

At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer\\'s details.\\n\\nWill and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child.

Sean\\'s explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife\\'s death.\\n\\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency\\'s moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him.\\n\\nWill breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day.

Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo\\'s workplace in search of Neo. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo\\'s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Trinity takes Neo to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\\n\\nMorpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix or blue to make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort until he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus\\'s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the history: in the early 21st century, humanity had developed intelligent machines before war broke out between the two sides. After humans blocked the machines\\' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\\n\\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix\\'s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo\\'s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus\\'s belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus\\'s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\\n\\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix, murders three crew members, and severely wounds a fourth, Tank. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists on accompanying him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\\n\\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee, and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship\\'s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels.

Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside Lieutenant Jim Gordon, much to the disdain of the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). The Riddler has left a message for Batman at the crime scene. The following night, the Riddler kills Commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell\\'s car containing images of Mitchell\\'s affair with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by Oswald \"The Penguin\" Cobb,[a] who is crime boss Carmine Falcone\\'s lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Annika\\'s roommate Selina Kyle works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage, Mitchell, and the district attorney Gil Colson are on Falcone\\'s payroll.\\n\\nThe Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell\\'s funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson\\'s phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mob boss Salvatore Maroni\\'s operation—and is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni\\'s operation was transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika\\'s corpse in the trunk of a car. Batman captures the Penguin after a car chase, but he and Gordon learn that the Penguin is not the informant.\\n\\nBatman and Gordon follow the Riddler\\'s trail to the ruins of an orphanage initially funded by Bruce\\'s deceased parents Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family for failing the orphanage. Bruce\\'s butler and caretaker Alfred Pennyworth is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill Maroni\\'s journalist who was writing a story about Martha\\'s family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence; upon learning that Falcone had murdered the journalist instead, Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them.\\n\\nSelina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that Falcone killed Annika for discovering that he was the informant, Selina tries to kill him, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the Riddler kills Falcone with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has planted car bombs and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál. The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton\\'s followers attempt to kill Reál, but Batman and Selina manage to stop them. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[b] while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves.

Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.\\n\\nBy 1986, following the Macintosh\\'s apparent failure, Jobs has founded a new company, NeXT. Before the NeXT Computer launch at the War Memorial Opera House in 1988, he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa. However, his relationship with Brennan is still strained. He accuses her of irresponsible behavior and using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs\\' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor who directs \"musicians\" like Wozniak.\\n\\nApple CEO John Sculley demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh\\'s lackluster sales. Despite Sculley\\'s warnings, Jobs criticized the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT\\'s unclear direction, she realizes Jobs designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.\\n\\nBy 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall.

After Saunière\\'s body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order and an anagram: \"O, draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!\" Langdon explains to Fache that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.\\n\\nSophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière\\'s estranged granddaughter and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather\\'s message, which was meant for Neveu, said \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\", which Fache had erased prior to Langdon\\'s arrival. However, \"P.S.\" does not refer to \"postscript\", but rather to Sophie — the nickname given to her by her grandfather was \"Princess Sophie\". She understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads to Leonardo da Vinci\\'s Mona Lisa, which in turn leads to his painting Madonna of the Rocks. They find a pendant that holds the address of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich.\\n\\n\\nReplica cryptex: prize from Google Da Vinci Code Quest Contest\\nNeveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box, which is unlocked with the Fibonacci sequence, they find a box containing the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When they are lined up correctly, they unlock the device, but if the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.\\n\\nLangdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon\\'s friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup but connected to Mary Magdalene, and that she was Jesus Christ\\'s wife and is the person to his right in The Last Supper. The trio then flee the country on Teabing\\'s private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spells out Neveu\\'s given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.\\n\\nDuring the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier: arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnessed a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather\\'s country estate. From her hiding place, she was shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who were wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She fled the house and broke off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as hieros gamos or \"sacred marriage\".\\n\\nBy the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and fathered children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex\\'s password, which Langdon realizes is \"apple\". Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect Opus Dei and Silas\\' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, Silas assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.\\n\\nThe final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu\\'s long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu\\'s long-lost grandmother and Saunière\\'s wife who was the woman who participated with him in the \"sacred marriage\". It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life. The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below La Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the \"Rose Line\", an allusion to \"Rosslyn\". Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line (prime meridian) to La Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Other'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Ada Lovelace',\n","    'movie_name': 'The Imitation Game',\n","    'summary': \"In 1951, police investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, Turing talks of his work at Bletchley Park during WWII.\\n\\nIn 1928, the young Turing is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography, he soon develops romantic feelings. However, Christopher shortly dies from tuberculosis.\\n\\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards in Bletchley Park, directed by Commander Alastair Denniston. They are to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\\n\\nDifficult to work with, and believing his colleagues inferior, Turing works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. When Denniston refuses to fund the machine's £100,000 construction cost, Turing contacts Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who makes him team leader and funds them. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements.\\n\\nCambridge graduate Joan Clarke passes Turing's test but her family will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. Clarke helps Turing warm to the others, who begin to respect him.\\n\\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; as the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes.\\n\\nWhen Clarke plans to leave because of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who advises he keep secret.\\n\\nOverhearing a clerk talking about messages she receives from the same German coder and always contain the same combination of letters at the beginning, Turing has an epiphany: he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. They realize that the answer to the daily code combination is in the 6:00 am weather forecast, and that all telegrams contain the same phrase 'Heil Hitler', which reveals enough of the day's Enigma code for Christopher to quickly decode all the messages that same day. Recalibrating the machine, it quickly decodes a message, and the cryptographers celebrate.\\n\\nDiscovering a British convoy is about to be attacked, Turing realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it, the Germans will know Enigma is compromised and change it. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although Peter begs them, as his brother serves on one of the ships. Turing asks Chief of MI6 Stewart Menzies to keep this discovery a secret, and in return promises to create a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection.\\n\\nDiscovering Cairncross is a Soviet spy, Turing confronts him. Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies, working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality if he divulges his identity. When Menzies threatens to have Clarke arrested as a suspected spy, Turing reveals that the spy is actually Cairncross. Menzies reveals that he already knew, and he had put Cairncross in the team so he could choose exactly what information to leak to the Soviets for British benefit.\\n\\nTuring urges Clarke to leave Bletchley Park and terminate their engagement, telling her he is a homosexual. She reacts calmly, saying she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway, as she never expected them to have a 'normal marriage' like most couples. Fearing for her safety, Turing says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Although heartbroken, Clarke stays on, knowing how important their task is. She refuses to bow down to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or what they think of her decisions.\\n\\nAfter the war, Menzies has the cryptographers destroy the evidence, as MI6 wants governments to believe they have unbreakable code machines. The team should never meet again or share what they have done.\\n\\nIn 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and chooses to undergo chemical castration instead of going to prison, so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him, witnesses his physical and mental deterioration, and tries to comfort him that he has saved countless lives and made the world an infinitely better place.\\n\\nThe epilogue shows Turing committed suicide on June 7, 1954, after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous Royal Pardon. Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by over two years, saving over 14 million lives; and Turing's work was an important step towards today's computers.\"},\n","   {'character_name': 'Andy Dufresne',\n","    'movie_name': 'The Shawshank Redemption',\n","    'summary': 'In 1947, Portland, Maine banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover.

Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer\\'s details.\\n\\nWill and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau\\'s supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery.\\n\\nIn desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will\\'s defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.\\n\\nWill is particularly struck by Sean\\'s story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean\\'s explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife\\'s death.\\n\\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency\\'s moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him.\\n\\nWill breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\\n\\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will\\'s potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault by repeatedly stating, \"It\\'s not your fault\", causing him to break down in tears in Sean\\'s arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical.\\n\\nWill\\'s friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will\\'s to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Ibrahim Aoumar',\n","    'movie_name': 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco',\n","    'summary': 'Jimmie Fails is a young man living in Bayview–Hunters Point, San Francisco.

Jimmie says it was built by his grandfather in 1946, who opted to build on an empty lot rather than buy one of the houses made available due to the wartime internment of Japanese Americans. The home is currently occupied by an older white couple. Jimmie often laments to Mont about how they don\\'t take care of the house, and does his best to maintain it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house to find the woman crying on her husband\\'s shoulder and movers taking the couple\\'s things away. They learn from a mover that the woman\\'s mother died and that she and her sister are now fighting over the house.\\n\\nJimmie and Mont visit Clayton Newsom, a realtor, to inquire about the home. Newsom is not aware of the current situation, but is very familiar with the house.

Jimmie and Mont later learn from Kofi\\'s friends that Kofi has been killed by a man with whom he had a scuffle. On returning to the house, they find that their possessions have been thrown out onto the sidewalk, and find a For Sale sign posted by Newsom. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie retaliates by taking all the furniture back inside. He also visits a bank in an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the home. Mont, however, goes back to Newsom, who reveals that the house wasn\\'t built by Jimmie\\'s grandfather; he has the deed proving that it was actually built in the 1850s.\\n\\nMont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi\\'s death, and Jimmie advertises that it will be performed in the house\\'s uppermost tower.

During the performance, Mont shows social media posts about Kofi\\'s death, all of which prove, he proclaims, that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks people in the crowd to recount their opinions of Kofi, including Jimmie. Jimmie says that even though the last things Kofi said to him were mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, and says, \"People aren\\'t one thing\". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie\\'s grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the audience.

Her party affiliation is never discussed. Formerly a United States senator from Maryland, Meyer campaigns for her party's nomination in the 2012 presidential election and is initially the front-runner, but ultimately loses the nomination to Stuart Hughes. Meyer subsequently joins the Hughes ticket as his running mate and is elected vice president. Her staff as vice president, upon whom Meyer is almost totally reliant, includes chief of staff Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky), director of communications Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), deputy director of communications Dan Egan (Reid Scott), body man Gary Walsh (Tony Hale), and personal secretary Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw). Later additions to her team as president include White House Chief of Staff Ben Cafferty (Kevin Dunn) and political strategist Kent Davison (Gary Cole). Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons), initially a White House liaison to the vice president's office and later a New Hampshire congressman, also features prominently.\\n\\nMeyer frequently finds herself relegated and ignored by Hughes, who is never depicted on-screen at the outset of the series. In the second season, Meyer comes to accrue some power and influence and, by the end of the season, is actively considering challenging Hughes for their party's nomination in the 2016 election. This becomes a moot point when Hughes abruptly resigns due to his wife's poor mental health and Meyer becomes president. Meyer begins her presidential campaign at the end of the third season. The fourth season finds her adjusting to her new role while continuing her presidential campaign, both of which are undermined by a series of scandals. The election results in a tie between Meyer and challenger Bill O'Brien (Brad Leland), leading to a contingent election in the House of Representatives during the fifth season to decide the next president after a recount in Nevada fails to alter the election's outcome. The House vote ends in a tie, meaning that when the Senate votes to elect the vice president the winner will be the next president. The Senate vote also ends in a tie; Meyer's disgruntled Vice President Andrew Doyle (Phil Reeves), who did not run for a full term, casts the tiebreaking vote for O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez (Andrea Savage) instead of Meyer's running mate Tom James (Hugh Laurie), leading to Montez becoming president. The sixth season follows Meyer out of office for the first time in the series, as she attempts to ensure her legacy by authoring a memoir, setting up a foundation and attempting to establish a presidential library. At the end of the season, Meyer decides to run for president again. The seventh season sees Meyer attempting to run for president once again in the 2020 election, featuring her former political rivals Ryan and James as major competitors, in addition to introducing the young, likable, and progressive challenger Kemi Talbot (Toks Olagundoye).\\n\\nThe series also explores Meyer's personal life, such as her strained relationships with her daughter Catherine (Sarah Sutherland), ex-husband Andrew (David Pasquesi), and several significant others.

His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which would lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela\\'s predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.\\n\\nWhile attending a game between the Springboks, the country\\'s rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that some black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year\\'s time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with Francois a British poem, \"Invictus\", that had inspired him during his time in prison.\\n\\nFrançois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.\\n\\nThings begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela\\'s efforts. Mandela\\'s security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades\\' professionalism and dedication.\\n\\nAs Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their arch-rivals—Australia, the defending champions and known as the Wallabies—in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in Taiwan, defeat France in heavy rain to advance to the final against their other arch-rival: New Zealand, known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20–19–2) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.\\n\\nMeanwhile, one day during the tournament, the Springbok team visited Robben Island, where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela\\'s will and his idea of self-mastery in \"Invictus\". Francois mentions his amazement that Mandela \"could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put him there\".\\n\\nSupported by a large home crowd of all races at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg, Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela\\'s security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a South African Airways Boeing 747-200 jetliner flies in low over the stadium. However, it is not an assassination attempt, but a demonstration of patriotism, with the message \"Good Luck, Bokke\"—the Springboks\\' Afrikaans nickname—painted on the undersides of the plane\\'s wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar\\'s #6 jersey.\\n\\nThe Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15–12 in extra time, thanks to a drop goal from fly-half Joel Stransky. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the William Webb Ellis Cup, as the Springboks are now indeed rugby union\\'s world champions. Mandela\\'s car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. He insists that there is no hurry as his security team wanted to change the route due to the cheering crowd.

Richard destroys the royal pardon and commissions James Tyrrell to execute Clarence, ostensibly in compliance with Clarence\\'s death sentence. Richard informs Edward of Clarence\\'s death at a meeting with Prime Minister William Hastings, and the King dies from a stroke. As Edward\\'s sons are underage, Richard becomes Regent, taking the title of Lord Protector with the support of the ambitious and corrupt Henry Buckingham.\\n\\nTo undermine his rivals for the throne, Richard has Rivers, the Queen\\'s brother, assassinated and uses the sordid circumstances of his death to damage the Queen\\'s reputation and cast doubt on her sons\\' legitimacy.

By doing so, Philip, with the pope\\'s blessing, would overthrow Elizabeth and take control of England. Philip agrees and plots to take over England and make his daughter, Isabella, the Queen of England in Elizabeth\\'s place.

Queen Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks Elizabeth \"Bess\" Throckmorton, her most favoured lady-in-waiting, to observe him. Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and they begin a secret affair. With tensions strained between England and Spain, Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. John Dee.\\n\\nJesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary of Scots, in what King Philip calls \"The English Enterprise,\" historically known as the Babington Plot. From her imprisonment, Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits, who recruit Anthony Babington to assassinate Elizabeth. Walsingham continues to warn Queen Elizabeth of Spain\\'s rising power and of the Catholic plots against her, but unlike her predecessor and half-sister, Queen Mary, Elizabeth refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs.\\n\\nWalsingham\\'s Catholic brother, who knows of the plot against Elizabeth, is jailed, leading Walsingham to reveal Spain\\'s plan to Queen Elizabeth, who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats. The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses her of receiving stolen Spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh.

Mary writes letters condoning the plot.\\n\\nBabington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and fires a pistol at her, though Elizabeth is unharmed as there was no bullet in the gun. As Elizabeth learns of Mary\\'s involvement in the plot, Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. Elizabeth reluctantly agrees. Mary is tried for high treason and beheaded; Walsingham realises this was part of the Jesuits\\' plan all along: Philip never intended for Mary to become queen, but with the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarding Mary as the true Queen of England, Philip uses Mary\\'s death to obtain papal approval for war. The \"murder\" of the last legitimate Catholic claimant to the throne gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and remove Elizabeth, leaving the way to the English throne free for his own daughter.\\n\\nBess reveals to Raleigh that she is pregnant with his child, and pleads with him to leave. Instead, the couple marry in secret. When Elizabeth confronts Bess, she confesses her pregnancy and that Raleigh is her husband.

The president and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friend A. J. MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill. However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives reject it, and liberals think it is too weak. If passed, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed to be guaranteed. Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and have the Congressional support to pass it, by his State of the Union Address.\\n\\nWhen the widowed President's cousin Judith is sick and unable to act as hostess at a state dinner for the French president, Shepherd realizes his staff's public portrayal of him as lonely widower is true. Soon after, Shepherd meets and is attracted to Sydney Ellen Wade, a lawyer employed by an environmental lobbying firm working to pass legislation to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He invites Sydney to act as hostess (and his date) at the state dinner, where she charms the guests and shares a dance with Andy.\\n\\nDuring a meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill before his State of the Union Address, he will deliver the last ten. MacInerney believes Wade will fail to obtain enough votes, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.\\n\\nShepherd and Wade begin seeing each other and fall in love. Republican presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson steps up his attacks, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and family values. The President's refusal to refute Rumson's aspersions lowers his approval ratings and erodes crucial political support that threatens the crime bill.\\n\\nWade is dejected after her failed meeting with three Michigan congressmen to discuss the environmental bill. When she tells Shepherd about the meeting, she inadvertently mentions that the congressmen want to defeat both the President's crime bill and Wade's environmental bill. Shepherd and MacInerney are conflicted about how they obtained this sensitive information. However, they are unable to ignore the opportunity to pass the crime bill, even if it means the President going back on his deal with Wade.\\n\\nEventually, Wade secures enough votes for the environmental bill while Shepherd is three short. He can only obtain them by shelving the environmental bill to solidify the three Michigan congressmen's votes for the crime bill  – which he agrees to do.\\n\\nWade's firm fires her for failing to achieve their objectives and for seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. She goes to see Shepherd to end their relationship and says she has a job opportunity in Hartford, Connecticut.

He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels – far more than the 10% originally proposed. Furthermore, he is withdrawing the crime bill for a stronger one with significant gun control measures.\\n\\nShepherd's passion galvanizes the press and his staff.

These include a broken pocket watch, an old spelling bee medal, a pocket knife, and two carved soap dolls resembling Jem and Scout.\\n\\nAtticus, a lawyer, strongly believes \"all people deserve fair treatment, in turning the other cheek, and in defending what you believe.\" Many of Atticus\\' clients are poor farmers who pay for his legal services in trade, often leaving him fresh produce, firewood, and so on.[5] Atticus\\' work as a lawyer often exposes Scout and Jem to the town\\'s racism, aggravated by poverty. As a result, the children mature more quickly.\\n\\nThe local judge asks Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, an African-American accused of raping a white girl named Mayella Ewell, and Atticus agrees. This heightens tension in the town and causes Jem and Scout to experience schoolyard taunts.\\n\\nOne evening before the trial, Atticus sits out front to safeguard Robinson when a lynch mob arrives. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly interrupt the confrontation. Scout, unaware of the mob\\'s purpose, recognizes Mr. Cunningham and asks him to say hello to his son Walter, her classmate. He becomes embarrassed, and the mob disperses.\\n\\nAt the trial, it is alleged that Tom entered the Ewell property at Mayella\\'s request to chop up a chifforobe and that Mayella showed signs of having been beaten around that time. One of Atticus\\' defensive arguments is that Tom\\'s left arm is disabled due to a farming accident years ago, yet the supposed rapist would have had to mostly assault Mayella with his left hand before raping her.\\n\\nAtticus shows that Mayella\\'s father, Bob Ewell, is left-handed, implying that he beat Mayella because he caught her seducing the young African-American defendant. He also states that a doctor never examined Mayella after the alleged rape. Taking the stand, Tom denies he attacked Mayella, but states that she kissed him against his will. He testifies that he had previously assisted Mayella with various chores at her request because he \"felt sorry for her\" – words that incite a swift, negative reaction from the prosecutor, and a gasp from the white audience.\\n\\nIn his closing argument, Atticus asks the all-white male jury to cast aside their prejudices and focus on Tom\\'s obvious innocence. However, Tom is found guilty. As Atticus exits the courtroom, the African-American spectators in the balcony rise to show their respect and appreciation.\\n\\nWhen Atticus arrives home, Sheriff Tate tells him Tom was killed during his transfer to prison, supposedly while attempting to escape.

Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial.\\n\\n42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the Forbidden City by the dying Empress Dowager Cixi. After telling him that the previous emperor had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace eunuchs and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his wet nurse, Ar Mo.\\n\\nAs he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, Pujie, who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a republic; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, Reginald Johnston is appointed as Puyi\\'s tutor and gives him a Western-style education, and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers\\' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds Wanrong, with Wenxiu as a secondary consort.\\n\\nPuyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to Tientsin following the Beijing Coup. He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile, and sides with Japan after the Mukden Incident. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to opium addiction. In 1934, the Japanese crown him \"Emperor\" of their puppet state of Manchukuo, though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to an illegitimate child, but the baby is murdered at birth by the Japanese and proclaimed stillborn. She is then taken to a clinic where her physical and mental state declines even further. Puyi remains the nominal ruler of the region until Japan\\'s capitulation. He decides to surrender to the Americans but before he can leave, he is captured by the Soviet Red Army and handed over to the Chinese.\\n\\nUnder the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959.\\n\\nSeveral years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence following the rise of Mao Zedong\\'s cult of personality and the Cultural Revolution. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, celebrating the rejection of landlordism by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans.\\n\\nPuyi later visits the Forbidden City, now turned into a museum, where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement. The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the Son of Heaven before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet cricket that he was given by palace official Chen Baochen on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared.\\n\\nIn 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace.

By doing so, Philip, with the pope\\'s blessing, would overthrow Elizabeth and take control of England. Philip agrees and plots to take over England and make his daughter, Isabella, the Queen of England in Elizabeth\\'s place. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is being pressured by her advisor, Francis Walsingham, to marry; if Elizabeth dies childless, the throne will pass to her first cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who is Catholic.\\n\\nEnglish explorer Walter Raleigh is presented at court, having returned from the New World. Queen Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks Elizabeth \"Bess\" Throckmorton, her most favoured lady-in-waiting, to observe him. Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and they begin a secret affair. With tensions strained between England and Spain, Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. John Dee.\\n\\nJesuits in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary of Scots, in what King Philip calls \"The English Enterprise,\" historically known as the Babington Plot. From her imprisonment, Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits, who recruit Anthony Babington to assassinate Elizabeth.

As Elizabeth learns of Mary\\'s involvement in the plot, Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. Elizabeth reluctantly agrees. Mary is tried for high treason and beheaded; Walsingham realises this was part of the Jesuits\\' plan all along: Philip never intended for Mary to become queen, but with the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarding Mary as the true Queen of England, Philip uses Mary\\'s death to obtain papal approval for war.

He defeats an assassin sent to kill her and she departs.\\n\\nAfter the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Moriarty taunts him about murdering Adler and indicates he will kill Watson and Mary due to Holmes\\' interference.

The trio follows Holmes\\' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, the bomb is in a nearby hotel; its explosion kills several businessmen.\\n\\nThe bomb was a cover for the assassination of Alfred Meinhard by Sebastian Moran, expert sharpshooter and henchman to Professor Moriarty. His death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhard\\'s arms factory in Heilbronn.\\n\\nThe trio follows Moriarty to Germany. At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty\\'s plot, revealing that the Professor acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies and intends to instigate a major world war to make himself a fortune.\\n\\nWatson uses a cannon to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and Holmes escape and Holmes deduces that Moriarty\\'s final target will be a peace summit in Switzerland, creating an international incident. At the summit, Holmes deduces that René is the assassin and is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical reconstructive surgery by Hoffmanstahl.\\n\\nHolmes and Moriarty meet on a balcony to discuss their plans over a game of chess. Watson and Simza stop René\\'s assassination attempt; René is killed by Moran, who flees. Despite his war being averted, Moriarty remains confident in his victory, predicting to Holmes that the nations of Europe will inevitably go to war with one another regardless of Moriarty\\'s manipulations.\\n\\nHolmes reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professor\\'s personal diary that contained his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary, who decorated the code using a book Holmes had noticed in Moriarty\\'s office, before passing the information to Inspector Lestrade, who seizes Moriarty\\'s assets and donates his fortune to charities that help war widows and orphans.\\n\\nHolmes and Moriarty anticipate a fight, and both realize that Moriarty will win due to Holmes\\' injured shoulder. Out of options and with Moriarty vowing to kill Watson and Mary, Holmes grabs him and drags him over the balcony, just as Watson shows up, and the two fall into the Reichenbach Falls below, to their deaths.\\n\\nFollowing Holmes\\'s funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycroft\\'s that Holmes expressed a liking for before the summit. Realising that Holmes may have survived, Watson leaves his office to ask Mary about the delivery man.

A Last Alliance of Elves and Men is formed to counter Sauron and his forces at the foot of Mount Doom, but Sauron himself appears to kill Elendil (Peter McKenzie), the High King of Arnor and Gondor, and Gil-Galad (Mark Ferguson), High King of the Noldor. Just afterward, Elendil\\'s son Isildur (Harry Sinclair) grabs his father\\'s broken sword Narsil, and slashes at Sauron\\'s hand. The stroke cuts off Sauron\\'s fingers, separating him from the Ring and vanquishing his army. However, because Sauron\\'s life is bound in the Ring, he is not completely defeated until the Ring itself is destroyed. Isildur takes the Ring and succumbs to its temptation, refusing to destroy it, but he is later ambushed and killed by orcs and the Ring is lost in the river into which Isildur fell.\\n\\nThe Ring is found 2500 years later, and eventually it comes to the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) (A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the Ring after bearing it for 500 years), who takes it underground for five centuries, giving Gollum \"unnaturally long life.\" The Ring leaves him however, and is found by the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), much to the grief of Gollum. Bilbo returns to his home in the Shire with the Ring, and the story jumps forward in time sixty years. At his 111th birthday, Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew and adopted heir Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and brutally tortured by Sauron\\'s Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Sam (Sean Astin) to Bree, with plans to meet him there after Gandalf goes to Isengard to meet the head of his order, Saruman (Christopher Lee). Saruman reveals that the Nazgul, or Ringwraiths, have left Mordor to capture the Ring and kill whoever carries it; having already turned to Sauron\\'s cause, he then imprisons Gandalf atop Orthanc.\\n\\nFrodo and Sam are soon joined by fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). After encountering a Ringwraith on the road, they manage to reach Bree, and there they meet a Man called Strider (Viggo Mortensen), who agrees to lead them to Rivendell. They agree only because Gandalf isn\\'t there to guide them. After some travelling, they spend the night on the hill of Weathertop, where they are attacked by the Nazgul at night. Strider fights off the Ringwraiths, but Frodo is grievously wounded with a Morgul blade, and they must quickly get him to Rivendell for healing. While chased by the Nazgul, Frodo is taken by the elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) (also Strider\\'s beloved) to the elvish haven of Rivendell, and healed by her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving).\\n\\nIn Rivendell Frodo meets Gandalf, who explains why he didn\\'t meet them at Bree as planned. In the meantime, there are many meetings between various peoples, and Elrond calls a council to decide what should be done with the Ring. The Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires (that is, lava) of Mount Doom, where it was forged. Mount Doom is located in Mordor, near Sauron\\'s fortress of Barad-Dur, and will be an incredibly dangerous journey. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mount Doom as all the others argue about who should or shouldn\\'t take it. He is accompanied by his hobbit friends and Gandalf, as well as Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chain-mail shirt made of Mithril.\\n\\nAlso travelling with them are the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Boromir (Sean Bean), the son of the Steward of Gondor. Together they comprise the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship set out and try to pass the mountain Caradhras, but they are stopped by Saruman\\'s wizardry. They are forced to travel under the mountain through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After journeying partway through the Mines, Pippin accidentally gives away their presence to a band of orcs. The Fellowship then encounter a Balrog (Durin\\'s Bane is a Balrog residing within the mines), an ancient demon of fire and shadow, at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him.\\n\\nThe group flees to the elvish realm of Lothlorien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, Galadriel and her husband Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-Hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship. After resting, they decide to travel on the River Anduin towards Parth Galen. Before they leave, Galadriel gives Frodo the Phial of Galadriel. After landing at Parth Galen, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, who manages to escape by putting the Ring on his finger and vanishing. Knowing that the Ring\\'s temptation will be too strong for the Fellowship, Frodo decides to leave them and go to Mordor alone.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship are attacked by Uruk-Hai. Merry and Pippin, realizing that Frodo is leaving, distract the orcs, allowing Frodo to escape. Boromir rushes to the aid of the two hobbits but is mortally wounded by the orc commander Lurtz, and Merry and Pippin are captured. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find Boromir, who regrets attempting to steal the Ring and dies. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him.

One day while roaming the streets, Aladdin spots a beautiful girl who gets in trouble after giving away bread to children without paying. Aladdin comes to her rescue, and together they get chased by the Royal Guards. After a while they elude their pursuers, and Aladdin takes the girl to his place for some tea. The girl calls herself Dalia, and is the handmaiden to the Princess of Agrabah. She suddenly has to leave as another suitor for the princess, Prince Anders, arrives. Dalia happens to be Princess Jasmine and Dalia is the name of her handmaid and best friend. Meanwhile, The Sultan\\'s trusted councilor, Jafar, is plotting to overthrown the Sultan by getting his hands on the Magic Lamp. However, it is hidden in a enchanted Cave of Wonders, and only the \"Diamond in the Rough\" may enter, which he is not. So, he spends weeks searching for this Diamond in the Rough.\\n\\nOne evening, after turning down Prince Anders\\' hand in marriage, Jasmine receives a surprise visit from Aladdin, who has come to return her mother\\'s bracelet, which Abu stole. Still thinking she\\'s Delia, he leaves her with a promise to meet her again, but is caught by the royal guards. The next day, Aladdin finds himself in the desert with Jafar, who assumes that he is the Diamond in the Rough. He tells Aladdin that the girl he met was the princess and that he can make him rich enough to impress her if he helps him retrieve the lamp. By evening, they arrive at the cave, and since Aladdin is the Diamond in the Rough he is permitted to enter the cave safely. The Cave of Wonders is filled with wondrous treasures that tempt both Aladdin and Abu. However, they have been warned to only retrieve the lamp and not to be tempted by the treasure otherwise they would be trapped inside the cave forever. Along the way they meet a Magic Carpet and find the lamp. However, Abu becomes tempted by a big shiny ruby and takes it. This angers the spirit of the cave, and starts to cave in. Aladdin and Abu barely make it back with Carpet\\'s help, but end up trapped in the cave after Jafar takes the lamp and betrays him.\\n\\nTrapped inside the cave, Abu reveals that he stole the lamp back from Jafar. Aladdin notices the lamp is a bit dusty and gives it a rub. This causes the lamp to release a powerful Genie who can grant him three wishes, as long as he is holding the lamp. Aladdin wishes to escape from the cave (though he makes a wish without holding the lamp, keeping his three wishes in tact), and both he, Genie, Abu and Carpet find themselves in the middle of the desert. After seeing Genie\\'s potential, Aladdin wishes to become a prince in the hopes that he can be with Princess Jasmine. Genie transforms him into Prince Ali, and parade to The Sultan\\'s Palace, where the Sultan welcomes him.\\n\\nAladdin starts off a bit awkward being a prince and trying to impress Jasmine, especially when Genie has him dance spectacularly in front of the princess. Instead of being impressed she just leaves. Meanwhile, Jafar becomes suspicious of Prince Ali.\\n\\nLater, Aladdin decides to go and Jasmine in her room, while Genie takes Delia out for a late night stroll. By just being himself, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a magic carpet ride, where the two of them become close. While watching the village people from above, Jasmine figures out that Ali is Aladdin, but he manages to convince her that he is really a prince and that he dresses as a commoner to escape palace life. Then he takes Jasmine back to the palace and they share their first kiss.\\n\\nThe next day however, Jafar captures Aladdin, who has figured out who he really is. He threatens to have him thrown into bay unless he tells him where the lamp is. When Aladdin denies everything, Jafar personally pushes him out of his tower and falls into the sea. Abu and Carpet arrive with the lamp, and Aladdin manages to rub it before drowning. Genie rescues Aladdin, and after speaking with Jasmine they confront the Sultan of Jafar\\'s treachery. Jafar tries to hypnotize the sultan into thinking they are lying, but Aladdin destroys his staff, proving to the sultan of Jafar\\'s treachery. He is taken to the dungeon, but escapes after his parrot sidekick, Iago brings him the keys.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Sultan thanks Aladdin for revealing Jafar\\'s treachery, and would be happy to have him marry his daughter. This makes Aladdin decide not to use his last wish to set Genie free as he promised, as he believes he cannot keep up being a prince without him. Genie is disappointed that Aladdin wants to continue living a lie and retreats to his lamp. Aladdin goes back to his old home in deep thought, and comes to see that Genie is right. He needs to tell Jasmine the truth. Just then, he realizes the lamp is gone and is now in Jafar\\'s possession.\\n\\nJafar wishes to become sultan, but when the guards refuse to obey him he uses his second wish to become a sorcerer. He banishes Aladdin to the ends of the earth and threatens to kill Dalia and the Sultan unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. However, Genie sends carpet to find Aladdin and Abu.\\n\\nAs they proceed with the wedding ceremony, Jasmine notices Aladdin coming on carpet. She plays along with the wedding and once she gets close enough to Jafar, she swipes the lamp from him and jumps onto carpet. Jafar sends Iago after them, turning him into a giant parrot. They almost lose the lamp during the chase, but get it back. However, Iago steals it back, but then loses it when the Sultan interrupts Jafar\\'s sorcery on him. He changes back into a regular parrot. However, Jafar then casts a sand twister that capture Aladdin and Jasmine and brings them back to him. Jafar now has them at his mercy, declaring him the most powerful man in the world. However, Aladdin retorts by claiming Jafar is not as powerful as he wishes to believe. The Genie remains the most powerful being in the universe as he gave Jafar his power in the first place and can also take it away. Realizing what Aladdin says is true and that he is still just \"second-best\", Jafar uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie. Seeing Aladdin\\'s cunning plan, Genie grants his wish, turning Jafar into a monstrously powerful genie. With phenomenal, cosmic power at his command, Jafar declares himself ruler of the universe. However, as pointed out by Aladdin, the power of a genie comes with a price. Jafar receives his own golden shackles and a lamp prison, which sucks him inside along with Iago.\\n\\nFoiled and trapped by his own greed, Jafar\\'s magic over Agrabah is undone. As for Jafar\\'s Lamp, Genie sends it flying to the Cave of Wonders, where the bickering Jafar and Iago would be forced to remain, as prisoners, for many years. Aladdin apologies to Jasmine and the Sultan for deceiving them, and is just about to leave until Genie reminds him that he has one wish left to make himself a prince again or erase the law of a prince marrying a princess. However, Aladdin decides to use last wish to set Genie free.

The Combat Air Patrol of the Enterprise is vectored to meet the incoming aircraft, and the fighters involved are F-14 Tomcat interceptors, each manned by a pilot and a Radar Intercept Officer. The pilot of the lead ship is Lt. Peter Mitchell (Tom Cruise), going by the call-sign Maverick, a call-sign appropriate for his arrogant rule-bending attitude; his RIO is Lt. Nicholas Bradshaw, call-signed Goose. Their wing-mate goes by the call-sign Cougar with his RIO call-signed Merlin. The two F14s split up and are surprised when a second MiG, shielded from radar by riding within feet of its leader, appears. Cougar is outmaneuvered by MiG One while Maverick locks his missile radar on MiG Two, who promptly disengages. MiG One stays on Cougar and is only chased off when Maverick flies upside down, closes up on the MiG, and flashes an obscene gesture to the enemy pilot. The MiG disengages and the two Tomcats fly to the Enterprise, but Cougar is so rattled he cannot land, forcing Maverick, low on fuel and against orders, to abort his own landing and talk Cougar to the deck.\\n\\nCougar sees the captain of the Enterprise, known as Stinger, and turns in his wings. This forces Stinger to change his intended disciplinary action against Maverick, for he must send a Tomcat tandem for additional combat training at the Navy\\'s Fighter Weapons School in Miramar, CA, near San Diego, and the Captain is disgusted that Maverick is the only qualified candidate for the assignment.\\n\\nMaverick, however, is quietly overjoyed as he regards the assignment as an opportunity, and upon arrival begins to build a rivalry with a fellow Tomcat pilot, Lt.

Iceman chews out Maverick for his \"unsafe\" attitude and Maverick refuses to have any of it, even after the School\\'s leader, Commander Michael Metcalf - call-signed Viper - summons him to his office and threatens to expel him should he continue this way. Metcalf, however, knows Maverick, for Maverick\\'s father flew with him in Vietnam and was shot down when he engaged the enemy in \"neutral\" airspace.\\n\\nThe contest between Maverick and Iceman continues; in a later exercise Viper and Jester team up against Maverick and fellow F14 pilot Hollywood. Maverick breaks a cardinal rule by abandoning his wing-man to go after Viper, and in so doing Hollywood is \"shot down\" and then the same fate befalls Maverick.\\n\\nBut the worst is yet to come, for Maverick is teamed with Iceman and Maverick, determined to win the School contest, angrily chews out Iceman for taking too long to attack an enemy craft; Maverick takes the shot, but when the two aircraft get close, the backwash from Iceman\\'s Thrusters cripple Maverick\\'s engines and the F14 plunges toward the sea.

Ferris persuades Cameron to let them use his father\\'s restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT \"California\" to pick up Sloane (as part of their cover) to travel into the city. He also has Cameron impersonate Sloane\\'s stuffy-toned father to have Sloane excused for the day due to a faked death in the family. The rest of the school and many residents learn of Ferris\\' exaggerated illness and offer donations to help \"Save Ferris\". However, only two people are not convinced by Ferris\\' deception: his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), outraged at Ferris\\' ability to defy authority easily, and the school\\'s Dean of Students, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), believing Ferris to be truant.\\n\\nFerris and his friends arrive downtown and leave the Ferrari with two garage attendants (Richard Edson and Larry Jenkins), who drive off in it a short while later to take a joyride. Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron enjoy the sights, including taking in a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, visiting the Sears Tower, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and taking part in the Von Steuben Day Parade, with Ferris lip-syncing to Wayne Newton\\'s \"Danke Schoen\" and the Beatles\\' version of \"Twist and Shout\", dedicating the former to Cameron himself. Ferris also uses his ploys to pretend he is Abe Froeman, the Sausage King of Chicago, to dine at an upscale restaurant on Rush Street (while narrowly avoiding his own father who is dining out with some business associates).\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Rooney has gone off-campus to try to find Ferris, first at a local hangout, then to Ferris\\' home, where Mr. Rooney attempts to gain entry, but ends up getting stuck in the mud and losing his shoe and wallet while being chased by the dog. Jeanie comes home to look for Ferris, instead discovering Mr. Rooney, whom she mistakes for a burglar, kicking him several times in the face and retreating. She calls the police, forcing Mr. Rooney to flee the scene. When the police show up, they haul Jeanie in for prank calling, and at the police station, she talks to a drug dealer (Charlie Sheen), who tells her that she needs to stop obsessing about her brother and focus on herself. Jeanie\\'s mother shows up to collect her, upset at having to do so, and finds Jeanie making out with the boy.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Ferris and his friends retrieve the Ferrari, but discover on the way home that hundreds of miles have been added to the odometer, sending Cameron into a panic fearing his abusive father\\'s reaction. After calming Cameron down, Ferris comes up with a plan to run the car in reverse, in place, with its rear wheels jacked up, at Cameron\\'s father\\'s hillside garage, hoping to reverse the odometer. When they realize this is not working, Cameron unleashes his pent-up anger against his father, yelling about how his father loves the car more than his own son and damaging the front of the car, but comes to realize he is long due to stand up to his father, and vows to accept the consequences. Cameron calms down and rests himself against the car, but his previous actions have unbalanced it from the jack it was on, the car hits the ground, races in reverse, and crashes through a glass wall, landing in a ravine. Despite Ferris\\' offer to take the blame, Cameron still plans to admit his actions to his father and take the consequences.\\n\\nFerris walks Sloane home, then quickly races through the backyards of his neighborhood.

However, Jeanie, apparently having come to appreciate her brother\\'s craftiness, has beaten him home despite her mother\\'s demands and getting a ticket for speeding. She pretends to scold Ferris for trying to walk home from the hospital while he is so ill, and thanks Mr. Rooney for driving him home, making sure to show Mr. Rooney the wallet he left behind when he broke in earlier. Rooney is once again chased by the dog. Ferris races to his room and makes it into bed just as his parents check on him.

He warns them about the \"Careers\" from Districts 1 and 2 who have trained intensively at special academies for the Games and who almost always win. He also says that minor objects in the game can mean the difference between life and death. Objects like food, water, fire can only be provided by sponsors & to get sponsors you need to get people to like you.\\n\\nThere is a 2-week training & evaluation period where sponsors get to see the tribute\\'s skills. Katniss is a strong and smart competitor & gathers sponsor attention by shooting an apple in their buffet, during evaluation. She gets a high score. President Snow tells Gamemaker Seneca Crane to contain Katniss, lest she controls the games. During an interview with TV personality Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss. She is initially outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as \"sponsors\" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine, and tools.

Hanna kills two of the special forces team when they enter the cabin and then waits for the rest, knowing that they will assume her father to have killed the pair before escaping.\\n\\nHanna is taken to an underground CIA complex. Marissa is suspicious of Hanna\\'s request to talk to her, and sends in a body double (Michelle Dockery) instead. Hanna asks the body double where she met her father. The double, who is being fed answers through an earpiece by Marissa, answers the questions correctly, and Hanna starts to cry and crawls sobbing into the lap of the double, which makes the officials uneasy. They send soldiers and a doctor to her cell to sedate her. As they enter the cell, Hanna kills the double, and several others (stealing a handgun from one), breaks free through the ventilation system and escapes.\\n\\nShe finds herself on the run in the Moroccan desert, where she meets Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and Rachel (Olivia Williams), a bohemian British couple on a camper-van holiday with their teenage daughter, Sophie (Jessica Barden), and their younger son, Miles (Aldo Maland). She sneaks into the family\\'s camper-van and hitches a ferry ride to Spain with the goal of reaching Germany. The family is nice to her, and she and Sophie become friends, and spend some time together, even sharing a kiss.\\n\\nMarissa hires Isaacs (Tom Hollander), a former agent, to capture Hanna. Hanna travels with the family as they drive north. Isaacs and two skinheads trail them and eventually corner Hanna and the family in France, but she manages to escape, killing one of the men. Marissa arrives and interrogates the British family, finding out that Hanna is heading to Berlin, her place of birth. Arriving at the address her father had told her, Hanna meets with Knepfler (Martin Wuttke), an eccentric old magician and a friend of Erik\\'s, who lives in a Grimms\\' Fairy Tales-themed house in an abandoned amusement park. It is Hanna\\'s 16th birthday and Knepfler makes her breakfast. Hanna plans a rendezvous with her father. However, Marissa and Isaacs arrive. Hanna escapes, but not before she overhears comments that suggest Erik is not her biological father.\\n\\nLater, Hanna meets her father at her German grandmother\\'s apartment, whom Marissa had already shot, demanding he tell her the truth, and he reveals that he is not her father. Erik once recruited pregnant women into a program where their children\\'s DNA was enhanced in order to create super-soldiers. The project was shut down, with almost all of its subjects eliminated. In a flashback, Marissa is seen firing on a car, carrying Johanna Zadek, Hanna\\'s mother, two year old Hanna and Erik. The car crashes but the trio flees. Marissa follows, shooting Johanna as she lies on the ground but Erik escapes with Hanna into the woods.\\n\\nMarissa and Isaacs arrive, intent on killing them; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. Erik kills Isaacs in a brutal fight, and is shot by Marissa, who returns to the Grimm house. Hanna is there, having just discovered Knepfler dead. After a chase, Hanna and Marissa confront one another. Hanna pleads for an end to the killing, saying she does not want to hurt anyone else. Marissa says she just wants to talk, but Hanna starts walking away. Marissa shoots Hanna, who responds by shooting her with an arrow she pulled from Knepfler\\'s body. Hanna is knocked to the ground by a bullet. She gets up, gets her bearings and follows Marissa into a tunnel, noticing a deer, and then seeing her fleeing up a nearby water slide. An unarmed Hanna chases Marissa to the top of the slide\\'s stairs, as she shoots at her. Near the top, it becomes clear that Hanna\\'s arrow did more damage than Marissa\\'s bullet, and a disoriented Marissa falls and slides down the water flume just as she is about to shoot Hanna, dropping her handgun. Hanna follows the wounded Marissa, picks up the dropped gun, and shoots her in the heart. The bookend scene mirrors the opening of the film in which Hanna hunts and kills the reindeer.'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Creasy',\n","    'movie_name': 'Man on Fire',\n","    'summary': 'Former CIA SAD/SOG officer John W. Creasy (Denzel Washington) comes to Mexico to visit his old friend, Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken), who runs a security firm in Mexico. Rayburn convinces him to take a bodyguard position, and he is offered one by Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), Mexico City automaker. His young daughter Lupita \"Pita\" Ramos (Dakota Fanning) requires a bodyguard for her kidnapping insurance policy to take effect. There is one kidnapping every 60 mins in Latin America and 70% of the victims do not survive. Lisa Ramos (Radha Mitchell) is Pita\\'s mother, and she has rejected 5 candidates already. Samuel doesn\\'t want to overspend on a bodyguard and wants Creasy hired as he comes relatively cheap due to his drinking problem. Lisa selects Creasy as he is an American. Lisa can sense the sadness in Creasy.\\n\\nCreasy is aloof and keeps Pita at a distance, even though she tries to talk to him. Creasy struggles with alcoholism, burnout, and guilt over his actions with the CIA. When trying to commit suicide, the bullet in his gun misfires. He eventually focuses more on his job, bonding with Pita. Noticing Pita, a swimmer, becomes startled by the starter gun at her swim meets, he begins to coach her. She learns to react to the starter gun, diving into the water without flinching, eventually winning a meet.\\n\\nOne day, while waiting for Pita outside of her piano lesson, Creasy notices a car with two men circling the area, and two Federal Police officers block the street. As Pita emerges, he yells at her to run, but she freezes. The car pulls up and the men attempt to grab Pita, but he fires his gun in the air, causing her to run away. Creasy attempts to fend off the attackers, killing three, and wounding a fourth, but is critically wounded himself (he takes multiple bullets front on). Pita runs back to him but is then abducted by the remaining kidnappers. The police arrest Creasy for killing police officers on duty and also for being involved in the kidnapping of Lupita.\\n\\nWhile recovering from his injuries, AFI agent Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) has Creasy relocated to a veterinarian clinic, to protect him from the corrupt police. When he regains consciousness, he is questioned by Manzano, but refuses to divulge any information. He then meets reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero (Rachel Ticotin), who offers to help him investigate the kidnapping and expose the criminal & Police nexus. Pita\\'s ransom drop (arranged by the Federal Police) fails when the kidnappers are ambushed by rival criminals. The kidnappers\\' leader, \"The Voice,\" (Roberto Sosa) is enraged at his nephew\\'s death during the botched drop. Holding the Ramoses responsible, he informs Pita\\'s mother Lisa that Pita will be lost to her and Samuel forever as retribution. Creasy uses this to wage war on the kidnapping ring and police corruption responsible for Pita\\'s apparent death.\\n\\nHe tracks down, interrogates, and kills the getaway driver (Pita had one day noticed a car following them and taken down its registration number. Creasy gets the number from her diary in her room), followed by middleman \"Jersey Boy\" (Charles Paraventi) (proprietor of the rave in Neza, who was known to the getaway driver as the Guardian. Creasy gets an ATM card from the Jersey Boy, which is given to him by the Voice, and is used to withdraw $200 per week for expenses. He also reveals that a crooked cop Fuentes stole the money at the drop), and Lt. Victor Fuentes (Jesús Ochoa) (a lieutenant in the Anti-Kidnapping Division of the Federal Judicial Police and the head of the criminal \"La Hermandad\" syndicate), who coordinated the drop. From Fuentes, Creasy learns most of the ransom money (out of the $10 MM, Fuentes only got $2.5 MM) had been stolen before the ambush at the drop and that Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke), Samuel\\'s lawyer who suggested kidnapping insurance, loaded the money into Samuel\\'s drop vehicle. At Kalfus\\' home, Creasy discovers that he is already dead and finds a fax with bank account information leading to Samuel. Creasy gives the ATM card to Guerrero to find out who is putting money in that account.\\n\\nCreasy confronts Samuel and Lisa. Samuel explains that Kalfus recommended arranging a kidnapping so he could claim the insurance payout and pay the debts his father had left him alongside a ruined auto empire (Out of $7.5 MM stolen, Jordan kept $2.5 MM and gave $5 MM to Samuel). They were promised Pita would be unharmed. When the drop went bad, Samuel blamed Kalfus for Pita\\'s apparent death, killing him in a rage. Lisa, unaware of Samuel\\'s involvement, angrily tells Creasy to \"kill him or (she) will\". He leaves Samuel a gun and the bullet he previously intended to commit suicide with. Remorseful, Samuel loads the gun and shoots himself in the head.\\n\\nCreasy learns from Guerrero the ATM card he recovered earlier is linked to a man living on the edge of the city. Manzano\\'s people, acting on Guerrero\\'s information, infiltrate his home, finding a photo of \"The Voice\". Guerrero runs a story in her paper, revealing the ringleader is Daniel Sanchez. The ATM card belongs to Daniel\\'s wife Maria Rosas Sanchez (Rosa María Hernández) at the address of Daniel\\'s brother Aurelio (Gero Camilo).\\n\\nCreasy breaks into Aurelio\\'s, taking him prisoner, despite being shot in the chest in the process. He then calls Daniel, threatening to kill his family unless he turns himself in. However, Daniel reveals that Pita is still alive, and offers to trade her for his brother and him. Creasy agrees. Arriving at the overpass meeting place and seeing Pita, he crosses it on foot, meeting her in the middle. He says goodbye, assuring her he loves her before sending her to Lisa. Creasy and Aurelio get into Daniel\\'s car, but he succumbs to his wounds in transit. Meanwhile, Manzano tracks Daniel down and kills him, stating in the official report that Daniel died during the arrest.'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Spartacus',\n","    'movie_name': 'Spartacus',\n","    'summary': 'Set in 73 B.C., Spartacus tells the story of a Thracian slave who rises against the oppressive Roman Republic.

There, he learns the deadly art of combat and falls in love with Varinia (Jean Simmons), a fellow slave.\\n\\nAfter being forced to fight his friend Draba, who sacrifices himself rather than kill Spartacus, the Thracian leads a rebellion, killing the brutal trainer Marcellus and inspiring the other slaves to rise up.

In Venice Indy meets Schneider & uses the last clue left by Henry to find the 2nd marker. Indy takes an impression of the 2nd marker on a piece of a paper, which already had the impression from the first marker. The tunnels where the marker lies is drenched in oil & is set on fire by a cult determined to prevent discovery of grail. Kazim (Kevork Malikyan) is the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, the cult which is dedicated to protecting the Grail.\\n\\nIndy escapes with Schneider & is pursued by cult. He captures Kazim to learn Henry is in the castle of Brunwald in Germany. Kazim says that his cult is prepared to go to any lengths to keep the Grail safe. Kazim tells Indy to think if he wants to find the grail for his own glory or for the glory of God. Indy and Marcus study the markers and figure out the name of a city Alexandretta, near the modern city of Iskenderun. Marcus the map of the grail quest in Henry\\'s diary. Indy travels to Germany & finds that Schneider was working for Walter all this while who wants to grab the grail for himself & immortality. Walter takes Henry\\'s diary (which had the page with the map missing and that map was with Marcus) & presents it to Hitler in Berlin. Walter leaves Henry and Indy in the castle imprisoned, but they manage to escape.\\n\\nMeanwhile Marcus was in Iskenderun and was met by Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). Marcus and Sallah are confronted by German agents. The agents manage to kidnap Marcus and retrieve the map from him.\\n\\nHenry wants to retrieve the diary as it has the grail traps & the key to defeat them. Henry and Indy travel via a motorcycle to Berlin. Indy finds Schneider in Berlin & retrieves the diary. Elsa is horrified with the Nazis burning all the books in Berlin. She spots Indy, but allows him to get away, as she sympathizes with his cause. But the Nazi\\'s led by brutal SS Colonel Ernst Vogel (Michael Byrne) attack Indy & Henry & they barely escape (they were in an air ship and escape in an airplane) while learning from Sallah that Walter is going after the grail in Jordan.\\n\\nWalter bribes the Sultan of Jordan with a Rolls Royce Phantom to secure his permission to go after the Grail on his soil. Kazim is employed with the court of the Sultan and goes after Walter\\'s expedition to stop him. The cult and Indy attack Walter\\'s caravan at the same time. Kazim is killed by Vogel and his forces, while Indy manages to rescue Marcus and Henry, even as Vogel falls to his death from a cliff.\\n\\nIndy goes after the grail himself, being pursued by Walter. Indy reaches the temple which leads to the grail chamber. Walter reaches there and shoots Henry & forces Indy to retrieve the cup to save Henry\\'s life. Indy avoids the traps (Only the penitent man will pass, Only in the name of God will you pass, Only the one with faith would pass). Indy reaches the grail chamber & meets the 3rd brother who stayed behind to guard the grail. The 3rd brother is now old and was waiting to pass on the baton to the next Knight who came along on the Grail quest. Indy chooses the carpenter\\'s cup (it was made of wood, and all the rest were made of gold and jewels), rightly identifying it as the grail.\\n\\nWalter is killed drinking water from the wrong cup. Indy saves Henry (water from the cup heals Henry\\'s wounds). Schneider decides to escape with the grail, triggering an earthquake. The grail falls into a crevice, resting on a ledge. Schneider dies trying to retrieve it, but falling in. Henry persuades Indy to give it up & let the grail be.',\n","    'plot_role': 'Other'},\n","   {'character_name': 'Peter Venkman',\n","    'movie_name': 'Ghostbusters',\n","    'summary': 'After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them.

They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.\\n\\nFollowing a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: \"Zuul\". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana\\'s building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand.\\n\\nSuspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to \"Gozer the Gozerian\", a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be \"the Gatekeeper\". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is \"Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster\". The Ghostbusters agree they must keep the pair separated.\\n\\nPeck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana\\'s building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.\\n\\nThe Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters \"choose the form of the destructor\". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer\\'s avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway.

However, Westley is presumed dead after his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts.\\n\\nFive years later, Buttercup is forcibly betrothed to Florin\\'s Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a small Sicilian man named Vizzini, a giant from Greenland named Fezzik, and a Spanish fencing master named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who murdered his father. A masked man in black pursues them, as does Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers.\\n\\nAtop the Cliffs of Insanity, the man in black defeats Inigo in a fencing duel and knocks him out, chokes Fezzik into unconsciousness, and tricks Vizzini into drinking a deadly poison.

While tumbling down, he shouts, \"As you wish!\" Realizing the man is Westley, Buttercup throws herself into the gorge after him, and they are reunited.\\n\\nWhile making their way through the Fire Swamp to avoid Humperdinck and his soldiers, Westley explains that \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" is a transferable title that he assumed when the previous Roberts retired. Having found Buttercup, Westley intends to retire himself and pass on the title to someone else. Humperdinck captures the pair after they emerge from the Fire Swamp. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck after he promises to release Westley. Humperdinck secretly orders Count Rugen to take Westley to his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair. After Westley notices that Rugen has six fingers on his right hand, Rugen knocks him out.\\n\\nWhen Buttercup threatens to fatally stab herself if the wedding happens, Humperdinck falsely promises to find Westley for her. His real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing Guilder for it.

Lee takes the vest and pursues Griffin, while Carter shoots Sang dead in a gunfight and saves Russ. Lee has a brief altercation with Griffin that culminates in both dangling from the rafters. Griffin, holding on to the vest, falls to his death when its straps are torn, but when Lee falls, Carter catches him with a large flag. Han and Soo Yung are reunited and Han sends Carter and Lee on vacation to Hong Kong as a reward.

At a Halloween party, after Daniel sprays water on Johnny with a hose as payback, Johnny and his gang chase Daniel and brutally beat him until Miyagi suddenly intervenes and easily defeats them.\\n\\nAmazed, Daniel asks Miyagi to teach him karate. Although Miyagi declines, he agrees to accompany him to Cobra Kai to resolve the conflict. They meet the sensei, John Kreese, an ex-Special Forces Vietnam veteran who callously dismisses the peace offering. Miyagi then proposes that Daniel enter the upcoming Under 18 All-Valley Karate Championship tournament to compete against Kreese\\'s students on equal terms and requests that the bullying ceases while Daniel trains. Kreese agrees to the terms but warns that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will continue for both of them.\\n\\nDaniel\\'s training starts with days of menial chores that seemingly only serve to make him just a worker for Miyagi. When he becomes frustrated about it, Miyagi demonstrates that repetition of these chores has helped Daniel to learn defensive blocks through muscle memory.\\n\\nTheir bond develops, and Miyagi opens up to Daniel about his life, including the tragic loss of both his wife and son in childbirth at the Manzanar internment camp. Meanwhile he was serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment during World War II in Europe, where Miyagi received the Medal of Honor.\\n\\nThrough Miyagi\\'s teaching, Daniel learns both karate and essential life lessons, such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the principle that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. He applies the life lessons Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali.

He reluctantly does so, momentarily crippling Daniel and getting himself disqualified.\\n\\nDaniel is taken to the locker room, where the physician determines that he cannot continue. However, Daniel believes that if he quits, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him, so he convinces Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to help him continue.

The match is a seesaw battle, with neither able to break through the other\\'s defense.\\n\\nThe match is halted when Daniel uses a scissor-leg technique to trip Johnny, delivering a blow to the back of his head and giving Johnny a nosebleed.

Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship Sulaco but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the Nostromo had betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.\\n\\nA dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists, except for a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station's center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists, now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines, killing or capturing many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, causing the dropship to crash into the station.

She meets her new teacher, Ms. Blu Rain, as well as several other girls who all come from troubled backgrounds and are looking to get their GED to advance their educations. Precious\\'s life begins to turn around when she slowly starts to learn to read and write with the help of Ms. Rain and finds herself inspired by her. While she learns, she starts to meet with social worker Ms. Weiss, who learns about the sexual assault in the household when Precious accidentally reveals who fathered her children. One day, while telling a story in class, Precious\\'s water breaks and she is rushed to the hospital. She gives birth to a healthy son named Abdul and is acquainted with a kind nursing assistant named John McFadden. While in the hospital, Precious writes letters to Ms. Rain through her notebook that is taken to and from her by Joann, one of the girls in her class.\\n\\nOnce discharged from the hospital, Precious returns home to find Mary waiting for her. Mary asks to hold Abdul, but deliberately drops him before attacking Precious, angrily declaring Precious\\'s revelation about the abuse has resulted in termination of welfare payments. Precious throws her against a wall, retrieves Abdul, and after falling down the stairs and narrowly avoiding Mary deliberately dropping her television set on them from the top of the stairwell, she flees the apartment and eventually breaks into her school classroom for shelter. When Ms. Rain discovers Precious and Abdul sleeping the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious and Abdul to live, but they end up staying with Ms. Rain and her live-in girlfriend for the holiday. The next morning, Ms. Rain takes Precious and Abdul to find assistance, and Precious is able to continue her schooling while raising Abdul in a halfway house.\\n\\nMary soon returns to inform Precious of her father\\'s death from AIDS. Precious later learns that she is HIV-positive, though Abdul is not. Feeling dejected, Precious distracts Ms. Weiss and steals her case file from her office. As she shares the details of her file with her fellow students, she begins to hope for the future. Later, Precious meets with her mother, who brings Mongo to Ms. Weiss\\'s office. Ms. Weiss confronts Mary about her and Carl\\'s abuse of Precious, going back to when Precious was a toddler. Mary tearfully confesses that she always hated Precious for \"stealing her man\" by \"letting him\" abuse her and for eventually \"making him leave.\" Precious tells Mary that she finally sees her for who she really is and severs ties with her, leaving with both Mongo and Abdul. Mary begs Ms. Weiss to retrieve her daughter and grandchildren, but Ms. Weiss silently walks away, leaving Mary distraught.\\n\\nPlanning to complete a GED test to receive a high-school diploma equivalency, followed by college, Precious walks into the city with her children, ready to start a new life with a brighter future.

After a length of time alone and having eaten the remaining food, he ventures back into the city.\\n\\nHungry, Jamie tries surrendering to Japanese soldiers, who ignore him. After being chased by a street urchin, he is taken in by two American expatriates and hustlers, Basie and Frank. Unable to sell Jamie, they intend to abandon him in the streets, but he offers to lead them to his neighbourhood to loot the empty houses there. He is surprised to see lights on in his family home and thinks his parents have returned, only to discover that the house is occupied by Japanese troops. The trio are taken prisoner, transported to the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre in Shanghai for processing, and sent to an internment camp in Suzhou.\\n\\nNow, in 1945, nearing the end of the Pacific War and World War II. Despite the terror and poor living conditions of the camp, Jim survives by establishing a trading network—which even involves the camp\\'s commander, Sergeant Nagata. Dr. Rawlins, the camp\\'s British doctor, becomes a father figure and teacher to Jim. One night after a bombing raid, Nagata orders the destruction of the prisoners\\' infirmary as a reprisal but stops when Jim begs forgiveness.

Jim is overjoyed and climbs the ruins of a nearby pagoda to better watch the action. Dr. Rawlins chases him up the pagoda to save him, whereupon Jim breaks down in tears—saying he cannot remember what his parents look like. As a result of the attack, the Japanese evacuate the camp. As they leave, Jim\\'s trainee pilot friend goes through the ritual kamikaze preparation and attempts to take off in a Japanese attack plane. The trainee is devastated when the engine sputters and dies.\\n\\nThe camp prisoners march through the wilderness, where many die from fatigue, starvation, and disease. Arriving at a football stadium near Nantao, where many of the Shanghai inhabitants\\' possessions have been stored by the Japanese, Jim recognises his parents\\' Packard car. He spends the night there with Mrs. Victor, a fellow prisoner who dies shortly thereafter, and witnesses flashes from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki hundreds of miles away.\\n\\nJim wanders back to the Suzhou camp. Along the way, he hears news of Japan\\'s surrender and the war\\'s end. He is reunited with the now-disillusioned Japanese teenage pilot, who remembers Jim and offers him a mango, drawing his guntō to cut it. Basie appears with a group of armed Americans to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Basie offers Jim to come along with them, but he chooses to stay behind.\\n\\nHe is later found by American soldiers and placed in an orphanage, where he is reunited with his mother and father, though he does not recognise them at first.

Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee. They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas.

Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West. After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed by Orcs. They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her.

Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently raped by \"the Sisters\" prison gang and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\\n\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the decrepit prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to use Andy\\'s financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the library.\\n\\nBrooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself.

After the medical examiner concludes it was a shark attack, newly hired police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric and roughened local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming that an abnormally large shark killed her.\\n\\nWhen local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes that the killer shark is still out there. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull, where he finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner's corpse. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and coming close to killing Brody's son. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.\\n\\nDespite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, as well as Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\\n\\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo, and he reveals that he survived the attack on the USS Indianapolis, during which many US sailors were killed by sharks. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the overtaxed engine fails.\\n\\nAs the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark viciously attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the seabed. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark.

He wakes up in a hospital room, unscathed, and the doctors inform him he is the sole survivor of the derailment that killed all other 131 passengers. After attending a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note on his car asking how long it has been since he has been ill and inviting him to \"Limited Edition\", an art gallery operated by Elijah Price. He goes with his son Joseph to meet Elijah. Elijah explains his theory of real-life superheroes, and if he represents extreme frailty, that there must be someone \"unbreakable\" at the opposite extreme. David is unsettled and leaves but later finds he can bench press 350 pounds (160 kg), well above his expectations. Joseph idolizes his father, believing him to be a superhero, although David maintains that he is an ordinary man.\\n\\nDavid challenges Elijah\\'s theory with an incident from his childhood when he almost drowned and contracted pneumonia. Elijah suggests that highlights the common convention whereby superheroes have a weakness, contending that David\\'s is water. David recalls the car accident in which he had been unharmed and ripped off the car door with his bare hands to rescue his girlfriend, Audrey. He feigned injury from the crash to quit football because Audrey disliked the violence of the sport.\\n\\nUnder Elijah\\'s influence, David realizes that his intuition for picking out dangerous people in his work as a security guard is actually extrasensory perception. Consciously honing this ability, David discovers that touch contact with people brings him visions of criminal acts they have committed. As people bump into him in a crowd, he senses the crimes they have perpetrated such as theft, assault, and rape. He finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who has invaded a family home, killed the father, and is now holding the mother and two children captive. David follows the janitor to the victims\\' house and frees the children. The janitor pushes him into a swimming pool from the balcony where he nearly drowns as he cannot swim, but is rescued by the children. David strangles the janitor to death, but finds the janitor has killed the mother. The next morning, David shows Joseph a newspaper article featuring a sketch of the anonymous hero, whom Joseph recognizes as his father and tearfully promises to keep his secret.\\n\\nDavid meets Elijah\\'s elderly mother, who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength and those who use their intelligence. Elijah asks David to shake his hand, which reveals that Elijah was responsible for numerous high-profile \"accidents,\" including David\\'s train crash, to find his superhero rival. Elijah tells David, \"Now that we know who you are, I know who I am\". He adopts his childhood nickname, \"Mr. Glass,\" as his supervillain moniker. David reports Elijah\\'s crimes to the police, and Elijah is confined to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane.

Instead, they recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the day the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, resulting in about 1,500 deaths.[Note 1]. After seeing a television report about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, revealing herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose and her granddaughter aboard the Keldysh, where Rose recounts her experience as a Titanic passenger.\\n\\nIn 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards the Titanic in Southampton with her wealthy fiancé, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth. Ruth stresses that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve their financial problems, but Rose is unhappy in the loveless engagement. Feeling trapped, Rose contemplates suicide by jumping from the ship's stern, but is stopped by Jack Dawson, a poor nomadic artist. Jack and Rose form a friendship, and Jack confesses his growing feelings for her. Though initially resistant, Rose realizes she has fallen in love with Jack, despite Cal's and Ruth's disapproval.\\n\\nRose brings Jack to her stateroom and asks him to draw her nude wearing only the necklace. Afterward, they evade Cal's valet, Spicer Lovejoy, and have sex in a car in the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear officers discussing the severity of the situation. When Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note she left, he arranges to frame Jack for theft by having Lovejoy plant the necklace on him. Jack is arrested and locked in the master-at-arms' office, while Cal places the necklace in his coat pocket.\\n\\nAs the ship begins sinking, women and children are prioritized for the lifeboats. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they return to the deck, where Cal urges Rose to board a lifeboat, claiming he and Jack will board another lifeboat. He unwittingly wraps his coat, containing the necklace, around her. However, as her lifeboat is lowered, Rose jumps back onto the sinking ship, unwilling to leave Jack behind. Enraged, Cal grabs a pistol and chases them through the flooding ship but gives up when they escape. Cal manages to secure a place on a lifeboat by pretending to be a child's father.\\n\\nAs the ship's flooded bow sinks, the stern rises into the air, and Jack and Rose cling to the railing. The ship splits in two, and the stern sinks into the freezing water with the remaining passengers. Jack helps Rose onto a small floating piece of debris and makes her promise to survive and live a full life. Jack dies from hypothermia, but Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, and later rescued by the RMS Carpathia. Rose remains hidden from Cal and her mother, and gives her name as Rose Dawson on her arrival in New York City.\\n\\nIn the present, Rose reveals that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the 1929 stock market crash. She tells the Keldysh crew that Jack saved her in every possible way, and laments that her memories are all that she has left of him. Touched by her account of the Titanic, Lovett abandons his search for the necklace. Alone at night on the stern of the Keldysh, Rose, who has kept the necklace in her possession all along, drops it into the sea above the wreck. Later, as she lies seemingly asleep in her bed, photographs on her dresser show a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack.[10] Aboard the pristine and undamaged Titanic, a young Rose reunites with Jack at the Grand Staircase, applauded by the passengers and crew who died in the sinking. \"},\n","   {'character_name': 'Ray Kinsella',\n","    'movie_name': 'Field of Dreams',\n","    'summary': 'Ray Kinsella lives with his wife, Annie, and daughter, Karin, on their corn farm in Dyersville, Iowa. Troubled by his broken relationship with his late father John, a devoted baseball fan, Ray fears growing old without ever having done anything to achieve his dreams.\\n\\nWhile walking through his cornfield one evening, he hears a voice whispering, \"If you build it, he will come.\" He sees a vision of a baseball diamond in the cornfield and \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson (who in real life died in 1951) standing in the middle. Believing in him, Annie lets him plow under part of their corn crop to build a baseball field, at risk of financial hardship.\\n\\nAs Ray builds the field, he tells Karin about the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. Several months pass until, just as Ray is beginning to doubt himself, Shoeless Joe reappears one evening. Joe asks Ray, \"Can I come back again? There were others, you know? There were eight of us.\" Ray replies, \"Any time; they\\'re all welcome here\". The next day, Joe returns with the seven other Black Sox players. Annie\\'s brother, Mark, cannot see the players. He warns the couple they are going bankrupt and offers to buy their land. The voice, meanwhile, urges Ray to \"ease his pain.\"\\n\\nRay and Annie attend a PTA meeting, where she argues against someone who is trying to ban books by Terence Mann, a controversial author and activist from the 1960s. Ray deduces the voice was referring to Mann, who had named one of his characters \"John Kinsella\" and had once professed a childhood dream of playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. That night, after Ray and Annie have identical dreams about Ray and Mann attending a game together at Fenway Park, Ray drives to Boston to find him. Mann, who has become a disenchanted recluse, agrees to attend one game. There Ray hears the voice urging him to \"go the distance\", seeing statistics on the scoreboard for Archie \"Moonlight\" Graham, who played in one game for the New York Giants in 1922 but never got to bat. Mann also admits to hearing the voice and seeing the scoreboard.\\n\\nThe pair drive to Chisholm, Minnesota, and learn that Graham, who became a physician, had died years earlier. Ray researches Graham, whose obituary said he was a beloved and charitable doctor, but makes no mention of his baseball career. Ray suddenly finds himself in 1972, and meets an elderly Graham, who feels his calling in life is medicine, not sports, and declines to visit Ray\\'s baseball field. During the drive back to Iowa, Ray and Mann pick up a young hitchhiker named Archie Graham, who is looking for a baseball team to join. Ray later tells Mann that his father dreamed of being a baseball player, then tried to make him pick up the sport instead. At 14, after reading one of Mann\\'s books, Ray stopped playing catch with his father, and they became estranged after he mocked John, saying \"[he] could never respect a man whose hero [Joe] was a criminal.\" Ray admits that his greatest regret is that his father died before they could reconcile. As they continue the drive, Mann and Ray acknowledge the building of the field, and bringing Joe back, is Ray\\'s penance for the estrangement with his father. Arriving at the farm, they see various all-star players of the 1920s have arrived, fielding a second team. A game is played and Graham finally gets his turn at bat.\\n\\nThe next morning, Mark returns, demanding that Ray sell the farm or the bank will foreclose on him. Karin insists that people will pay to watch the ballgames. Mann agrees, saying that \"people will come\" to relive their childhood innocence. Ray and Mark scuffle, accidentally knocking Karin off the bleachers. Graham\\u2009—\\u2009despite knowing he will be unable to return after stepping off the field\\u2009—\\u2009saves her from choking on a hot dog. Having become old Doc Graham again, he reassures Ray that he has no regrets. As he heads back toward the cornfield, he is commended by the other players, and before he can disappear into the corn, Shoeless Joe calls out, \"Hey, rookie!\", Graham stops and turns to Shoeless Joe, who tells him, \"You were good.\" Doc Graham\\'s eyes shine with tears before he smiles, turns back toward the corn, and disappears into it. Suddenly, Mark too can see the players and urges Ray to keep the farm after all.\\n\\nShoeless Joe invites Mann to enter the corn, and Mann disappears into it. Ray is angry at not being invited but Joe rebukes him, glancing towards the catcher at home plate, saying, \"If you build it, he will come.\" When the catcher removes his mask, Ray recognizes him as his father, John, as a young man. Ray and Annie then understand that \"ease his pain\" and \"go the distance\" both refer to his father. Ray says to Shoeless Joe, \"It was you\" [the voice], but Joe replies, \"No, Ray, it was you\".\\n\\nRay introduces John to his wife and daughter, without acknowledging him as his father. Later, as evening falls, John says goodnight to Ray and they shake hands. As John is walking towards the cornfield, Ray calls out, \"Hey, Dad...you wanna have a catch?\". John gladly accepts as hundreds of cars are seen approaching the field, fulfilling the prophecy that people will come to the field to watch baseball.

Catherine is uncooperative and taunts the investigators by smoking and exposing herself. Although she is released, Nick discovers that she has a history of befriending murderers. This includes Roxy Hardy, Catherine's girlfriend, who impulsively killed her two younger brothers at the age of 16, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her husband and children.\\n\\nNick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine during an undercover assignment, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner. The two have an on-and-off affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is using him as the basis for the protagonist of her latest book, in which his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. He becomes suspicious that she has bribed Lt. Marty Nilsen for his psychiatric file. In response, Nick assaults Nilsen in his office. Nilsen is found murdered, and Nick is suspected and placed on leave. Moran later uncovers evidence that Nilsen had been paid fifty thousand dollars three months earlier, before Nick had even met Catherine.\\n\\nNick and Catherine embark on a passionate but tense affair, much to Moran's chagrin given his suspicions about her. It starts one night when Nick sees Catherine snorting cocaine with Roxy at Boz's club. They return to Catherine's place and Roxy observes Nick and Catherine having rough sex, with Catherine tying Nick to the bed. This mirrors the way Boz was tied up by the mystery blonde. Jealous of Nick, Roxy tries to run him over with Catherine's car but dies when the vehicle crashes. Catherine is saddened by Roxy's death and confesses to Nick about a college encounter with a girl that ended badly as the girl became obsessed with her. Nick identifies that girl as Beth; Beth claims that it was Catherine who was obsessed. Catherine insists that the obsessive behavior came from Beth and even led her to file a report to the Berkeley campus police; when Nick visits Berkeley, he finds out that Catherine's report was withdrawn by Nilsen a year earlier. Nick also learns that a college professor of Catherine and Beth's was killed with an ice pick in an unsolved homicide that inspired one of Catherine's early novels.

Catherine breaks off their affair, leaving Nick upset and suspicious. He meets Moran, who has arranged to meet Catherine's college roommate in Oakland to learn about Catherine and Beth. Moran is stabbed to death with an ice pick in the elevator and Nick finds Moran's body in a fashion similar to the description in the book. Beth arrives unexpectedly and claims that she received a message to meet Moran. Nick suspects Beth of killing Moran and shoots her when he believes she's reaching for a gun. However, Beth was only fiddling with her keychain.\\n\\nEvidence implicates Beth in the murders of Boz, Nilsen, Moran, and her own husband. The investigators also find photos and newspaper clippings of Catherine that imply an obsession with her. Nick is left confused and dejected.

Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K.

He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets Judge Doom, the sinister human judge of Toontown—having bribed the electorate to gain their votes—and his five weasel minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the \"Dip\", a chemical concoction of acetone, benzene, and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.\\n\\nRoger\\'s toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme\\'s missing will—which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons—may have been the killer\\'s true motive.

Later, J.D. shows up at Veronica\\'s house, and they have sex after J.D. breaks in through Veronica\\'s bedroom window. They express to each other their mutual hatred of Chandler\\'s tyranny.\\n\\nThe next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into Chandler\\'s house, planning revenge by using a fake hangover cure to make Chandler vomit. J.D. pours drain cleaner into one of the mugs, but Veronica dismisses him, thinking he is making a mean joke. She mixes orange juice and milk together. Veronica accidentally brings the wrong mug to Chandler\\'s room. J.D. notices this but dismisses it when Veronica does not hear J.D. He serves Chandler the drain cleaner, killing her. Veronica panics, and J.D. urges her to forge a dramatic suicide note in Chandler\\'s handwriting. The community regards Chandler\\'s apparent suicide as a tragic decision made by a troubled teenager, making her even more worshipped in death than in life. Duke uses the attention surrounding Chandler\\'s death to gain popularity by going to many different news stations, as, after Chandler\\'s death, Duke feels the need to be the clique\\'s new leader.\\n\\nMcNamara convinces Veronica to go with her, Kurt, and Ram on a double date. J.D. finds the four teens that evening in a field, and Veronica leaves with him as Kurt passes out, while Ram rapes McNamara. The boys spread a false rumor about Veronica performing oral sex on them, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that he and Veronica lure the boys into the woods, shoot them with tranquilizers, and humiliate them by staging the scene to look like they were lovers participating in a suicide pact.\\n\\nIn the forest, J.D. shoots Ram, but Veronica\\'s shot misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back toward Veronica, who, realizing that the bullets are in fact lethal, fatally shoots him in a panic. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs to homophobia. Disturbed by J.D.\\'s behavior, Veronica breaks up with him.\\n\\nJ.D. blackmails Duke into getting every student to sign a petition that, unbeknownst to her, is intended to act as a mass suicide note. He then gives her a red scrunchie that Chandler wore, symbolizing her power over the school. Martha, an overweight girl who is a frequent target of bullying, attempts to kill herself by walking into traffic. She survives but is badly injured and mocked by her peers who believe she was attempting to copy the popular kids. McNamara calls a radio show to discuss her depression. Duke tells the entire school about the radio call, and McNamara is bullied. McNamara attempts suicide by overdosing in the girls\\' bathroom, but Veronica intervenes.\\n\\nVeronica returns home, and her parents say that J.D. stopped by to tell them that he is worried she will attempt suicide. Realizing that J.D. plans to kill her, she fakes her own suicide by hanging. J.D. finds her and, assuming she is dead, gives a monologue revealing his plan to blow up the school pep rally and make it look like a mass suicide.\\n\\nJ.D. plants dynamite in the gymnasium equipped with remote detonators. He proceeds to the school\\'s boiler room to place dynamite with a countdown detonator. Veronica confronts J.D. in the boiler room. She shoots him, and during his fall the switchblade in his hand cuts the wires to the detonator. Veronica goes outside, and J.D. follows her with a bomb strapped to his chest. He offers a personal eulogy and detonates the bomb, killing himself. As students and faculty rush to see what happened, Veronica walks back inside, disheveled from the explosion. She approaches Duke, takes the red scrunchie, and asserts that Duke is no longer in charge. Veronica invites Martha to spend prom night watching movies together. '},\n","   {'character_name': 'Mona Lisa Vito',\n","    'movie_name': 'My Cousin Vinny',\n","    'summary': 'While driving through Alabama, New York college students Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein stop at a convenience store, during which Bill accidentally shoplifts a can of tuna. After they leave, the boys are pulled over and arrested as the shopkeeper has been found robbed and murdered. At the police station, Bill assumes he has been arrested for shoplifting and confesses to being responsible, resulting in him being charged with first-degree murder and Stan as an accessory. Unable to afford a private lawyer, Bill asks for help from his cousin Vinny Gambini, a personal injury lawyer from Brooklyn, who agrees to help the boys. However, they are unaware that Vinny has only just passed the bar to become a lawyer, after multiple failed attempts, and has no trial experience. Vinny promptly arrives in Alabama with his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito.\\n\\nVinny fools the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, into believing he is an experienced New York lawyer who works under the alias Jerry Callo. Haller repeatedly holds Vinny in contempt for his unprofessional attire, attitude, and ignorance of courtroom decorum, resulting in brief stints in jail. The prosecuting district attorney, Jim Trotter III, presents a strong—although circumstantial—case against the boys, offering multiple witnesses to their involvement in the murder. Bill and Stan become concerned when Vinny declines to cross-examine the witnesses during the preliminary hearing, resulting in Stan firing Vinny and hiring the public defender, John Gibbons.\\n\\nVinny\\'s inexperience with the legal system leads him to try to trick Trotter into sharing his evidence until Lisa tells Vinny that he legally can access the prosecution\\'s evidence and prompts him to interview the witnesses, which he does. She grows frustrated with Vinny as he promised several years earlier that they would get married when he wins his first case and is worried he never will. Vinny is also eager to prove himself to his mentor Judge Malloy, who convinced him to go into law.\\n\\nDuring the trial, Gibbons\\'s nerves and severe stutter only further damage Stan\\'s defense. Meanwhile, Vinny uses an aggressive but perceptive questioning style to discredit Trotter\\'s witnesses, using his knowledge of the cooking time of grits to force one to admit that his perception of when the crime occurred is inaccurate, and the others by questioning their ability to positively identify the suspects due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision. Stan promptly rehires Vinny to defend him.\\n\\nThe next day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, FBI analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that tire markings at the crime scene match those on the boys\\' 1964 Buick Skylark, although Vinny makes him admit that the tires are the most used in America. Haller orders a lunch recess and denies Vinny\\'s request for a full day\\'s continuance to properly counter Wilbur\\'s testimony. Stressed by lack of sleep, Haller\\'s hostility, low funds, and the prospect of losing the case, Vinny lashes out at Lisa\\'s efforts to help, but realizes that one of the photos she has taken during their stay, showing the tire marks at the scene, may help the case.\\n\\nAfter asking the local sheriff for a favor, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness as she and her family have worked as mechanics and she has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. Looking at the photo, Lisa realizes that only the 1963 Pontiac Tempest, which resembles a Buick Skylark, could have made the tire tracks, thanks to its independent rear suspension and Positraction. Vinny recalls Wilbur who confirms this information, discrediting his own testimony. The sheriff arrives and testifies that, following Vinny\\'s request, he identified two men fitting Bill\\'s and Stan\\'s descriptions who have been arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen Pontiac Tempest and were in possession of a gun matching the murder weapon. His case dismantled, Trotter requests that Haller dismiss all charges. Bill, Stan, the Sheriff, Trotter, and Haller congratulate Vinny on his success. Driving away, Lisa admits that she had Judge Malloy help convince Haller of Jerry Callo\\'s \"successful\" legal career, before she and Vinny bicker about their wedding plans.

The company is opening the season with Tchaikovsky\\'s Swan Lake. After forcing the current prima ballerina, Beth, into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer for the dual roles of the innocent and fragile White Swan, Odette, and the sensual and dark Black Swan, Odile. Nina auditions and gives a flawless performance as Odette, but fails to embody Odile, causing Thomas to dismiss her.\\n\\nThe next day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider. He forcibly kisses her and she bites him and runs out of his office. Later, Nina is surprised to find she has received the lead role. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth publicly accuses Nina of providing sexual favors to Thomas in return for the role. The next day, Nina hears Beth had been hit by a car; Thomas believes she was attempting suicide. Nina visits Beth in the hospital and is distraught to see her injured legs; it is clear she will never dance again.\\n\\nDuring rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe a newcomer, Lily, who has a physical resemblance to Nina but also an uninhibited quality Nina lacks. Nina has hallucinations and finds scratch marks on her back. One night, despite Erica\\'s objections, Nina accepts Lily\\'s invitation to go out for drinks. Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule, which Nina reluctantly accepts. While intoxicated, Nina flirts with men at the bar and Lily as well. After the two dance at a nightclub, they go back to Nina\\'s apartment and have sex. The next morning, Nina wakes up disoriented and alone and realizes that she is late for rehearsal.\\n\\nAt rehearsal, Nina sees Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about their sexual encounter. Lily denies that it happened and mocks Nina for fantasizing about her. Nina becomes convinced Lily intends to replace her, especially after learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate. Nina\\'s mysterious injuries and hallucinations grow more severe, leading to an incident where she believes she is transforming into Odile. Erica grows concerned about her well-being and attempts to prevent Nina from performing on opening night.\\n\\nAfter a physical confrontation with her mother, Nina arrives at the theater, where she finds Lily preparing to take the stage as Odette because Nina has been absent. Nina convinces Thomas to allow her to take back her role. Towards the end of the ballet\\'s second act, Nina is distracted by a hallucination and loses her balance during a lift, causing a male dancer to drop her, infuriating Thomas. Nina returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing to play Odile. She confronts her and Lily appears to transform into a doppelgänger of Nina. The two fight, breaking a mirror. Nina stabs her doppelgänger with a shard of glass, killing her and breaking the illusion. Nina hides Lily\\'s body and takes the stage. She dances flawlessly as Odile and seemingly begins to turn into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss.\\n\\nIn her dressing room, Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, but is interrupted by Lily, who congratulates Nina for her performance. Nina sees the mirror is still broken, but all other evidence of the stabbing is gone, including the body. She looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she stabbed herself and not Lily. Despite her injury, she dances the final act of the ballet with blood gradually seeping through her costume. The show ends with her jumping from the set onto a hidden mattress to simulate Odette throwing herself off a cliff. Everyone erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the other dancers gather to congratulate Nina backstage. Thomas eventually realizes Nina is bleeding and shouts for help, asking Nina what happened. Nina calmly replies: \"I felt it. It was perfect,\" as the screen fades to white.

At an engagement party the next day at Ashley's home, Twelve Oaks, a nearby plantation, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley but is rebuffed; however, she catches the attention of another guest, Rhett Butler. The party is disrupted by news of President Lincoln's call for volunteers to fight the South, and the Southern men rush to enlist.

Fox). Marty D is a friend of scientist, Doc (Christopher Llyod). Doc asks Marty to meet him that night at the Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 a.m.. Marty asks him where he's been all week. Marty's girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) is his classmate at high school where Marty is always in trouble for being friends with Doc. Marty's dad George is a big league loser. & puts up with all kinds of nonsense from his supervisor Biff who totally rides rod-shod over George. Marty's mum Lorraine behaves like a nun & doesn't allow Marty any kind of freedom with Jennifer. The town clock tower was stuck by lightning 30 yrs ago & has been shut ever since. Marty has brother Dave & sister Linda. Lorraine's brother Joey was in jail & is just being released. Lorraine also reveals how she met George. George was in a tree, & was hit by Lorraine's dad's car who brought him home when he fell. Lorraine asked George to prom out of sympathy & when George kissed him at the dance, she decided to marry him. at 1 am Marty heads to twin pines mall to meet Doc who is with his modified Delorean car. Doc demonstrates that his car is a time machine, works on Plutonium & starts at 88 mph. Doc reveals that he got the Plutonium from Libyan terrorists who wanted a bomb, but Doc delivered a fake. Libyans attack & kill Doc. Marty hide in the car & accelerate to 88 mph & travel back in time to 1955 (the year Doc discovered the time machine formula). Marty realizes he has landed in the past & tries to find Doc. He finds young George being bullied by young Biff. George has a penchant for peeping & falls from a tree on to the path on an oncoming car. Marty pushes him & gets hit himself. The car owner takes Marty home. Marty wakes to young Lorraine looking seductively at Marty. Marty finds Doc & shows him the car to prove that he is from future. Doc promises Marty to get him back to 1985. The car required 1.21 GW, & in absence of plutonium only a lightning bolt will work. MArty remembers that the clock tower was stuck by lightning in 1955 & tells Doc. Doc also tells Marty that his messing with events in 1955 can impact the future. Already Marty can see his brother disappear from his wallet family photo. Marty has to get George & Lorraine together, but Lorraine loves Marty. Marty foiling Biff's plans to humiliate George only endear Marty even more to Lorraine. Lorraine asks Marty to dance & Marty tells George that he will try to take advantage of Lorraine & George can step in & be a hero. At the night of the dance & the night of the lightning bolt, Marty slips a note into Doc's coat saying that he was killed by Libyans in 1985. Marty is with Lorraine when Biff pushes Marty & takes Lorraine into his car & starts molesting her. George arrives & starts to rescue Lorraine, but its Biff. George is humiliated again, but summons the strength to knock Biff out. Marty meets Doc who has hooked a cable from the clock tower to the car to provide the power. Marty drives the car & gets it to 88 mph, just as lightening strikes & gets back to 1985. He finds Doc who is on his back & is distraught. But Doc is OK as he was wearing a bullet proof vest based on Marty's note. George and Lorraine arrive home from a tennis match, happy and even a bit frisky. Lorraine asks Marty about the camping trip he has planned with Jennifer, to which Marty mentions that the car is wrecked. Everyone starts barking about it until George shows them that Biff is waxing the car (a BMW) in the driveway. Biff comes into the house carrying a box filled with copies of George's first published book.\n","\n","I'm trying to identify the archetype of the character \"George McFly\" in this movie.
