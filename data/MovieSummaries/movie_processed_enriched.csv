975900,/m/03vyhn,Ghosts of Mars,14010832.0,98.0,['english'],2001-08-24,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Set in the year 2176, Mars has been 85% terraformed, giving the planet an Earth-like atmosphere. Martian society has become matriarchal, centering on the city of Chryse, with smaller outposts connected by an expansive network of trains. In the wake of a series of mysterious 'incidents', Police Officer Melanie Ballard is called before a tribunal to give testimony following a disastrous mission to the remote mining outpost Shining Canyon to retrieve convicted felon James 'Desolation' Williams, of which she is apparently the sole survivor.
Through a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks as new perspectives are incorporated into the narrative), Ballard recounts details of the mission. Accompanied by commanding officer Helena Braddock, cocky sergeant Jericho Butler and rookie officers Bashira Kincaid and Michael Descanso, Ballard arrives at Shining Canyon to find the town seemingly deserted. Investigating the local jail, Braddock discovers a trio of individuals who appear to have sealed themselves into one of the cells; among them science officer Dr Arlene Whitlock.
Ballard and Butler find a number of disoriented miners and the convict Williams, who has escaped. The group is attacked by several of the miners, causing Ballard and Williams to band together and incapacitate them. Ballard is forced to shoot and kill one of them, causing the affliction to be passed on to one of the three survivors. Butler, venturing out to the edge of town in pursuit of one of the feral miners, discovers a row of severed heads mounted on spikes, including the head of Commander Braddock and a large assembly in the canyon below committing horrific acts of self-mutilation and ritualistic execution.
Friends of Williams arrive and force Ballard and Butler to release him. While they originally plan on leaving the officers and remaining miners to die, Ballard convinces them to work together to survive. Their initial effort to escape is halted when the army of feral miners converge on their position, killing, injuring and infecting several of them. Confronted by Ballard, Whitlock eventually explains that she fled from her post after discovering an ancient underground vault created by an extinct Martian civilization. When the door to the vault was opened, it released hostile spirits or ""ghosts"", which took possession of the workers, causing their violent behavior. Killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another host. Ballard surmises that these Martian spirits believe humans to be an invading race. Ballard is briefly possessed until Butler feeds her a hallucinogenic drug, which forces the Martian spirit to leave her body.
The group is forced to flee as the possessed workers breach the jail, leaving only Ballard, Williams, Butler, Kincaid and Whitlock left alive. While they are able to make it to the train, Ballard realizes that they have a duty to exterminate the Martian threat and decide to return to Shining Canyon to overload the outpost's nuclear power plant, assuming that the ensuing atomic blast will vaporize the spirits. While they are able to initiate the meltdown, Whitlock is possessed, while Butler, Kincaid and the two train operators are killed. Boarding the train, the two watch as the army is engulfed in the explosion. Williams tends to Ballard's wounds. Unwilling to face the authorities, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and leaves. She moves to shoot him, but realizes her respect for him and lets him escape.
Resting after her tribunal, Ballard is woken by an alert that the city is under attack. Realizing their attempt to destroy the spirits failed, she readies herself to face the onslaught alone until she is greeted by Williams, who hands her a weapon. The two agree to fight their way out of the city together.",

The family admires their Christmas tree, as the film intercuts with scenes of JonBenét's autopsy. Before JonBenét is put to bed, John leads her in the Christian child's prayer ""Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep"". The following morning, Patsy finds a ransom note on the kitchen staircase. The note demands $118,000 in exchange for the return of JonBenét; it further claims that JonBenét will be executed if John and Patsy refuse to pay the ransom. Investigators arrive to the Ramsey residence and question John and Patsy in an effort to determine who wrote the ransom note. The residence is then thoroughly searched by the investigators, who discover JonBenét's corpse in the basement. The investigators call for an ambulance, as they remove duct tape from JonBenét's mouth and a cord that is tied around her wrists. As JonBenét's body is brought upstairs, John and Patsy become hysterical. A reverend leads the couple in prayer in an effort to calm them down.
Assigned to write a story about JonBenét's death, a reporter (Alice Barrett-Mitchell) travels to Boulder. Upon arrival to the city, she interviews the Ramsey's friends and neighbors, in addition to city officials. As she watches a televised interview with John and Patsy, the reporter begins to grow suspicious of the couple. She receives a call from a detective (Brad Greenquist) who claims that he wants her to know the truth about JonBenét's death. The detective, however, has second thoughts and ends the call. As investigators begin to consider John and Patsy as suspects, the reporter receives a second call from the detective. The detective claims that John and Patsy murdered JonBenét, however, he asks the reporter to not run the story over concerns that it will be traced back to him. As news coverage of the killing increases, the reporter receives a call from another detective (Albert Hall). This detective claims that John and Patsy are innocent, and that the Boulder Police Department are attempting to frame the couple. He alleges that JonBenét was actually killed by Bill McReynolds, Randy Simons, or Jeff Merrick, all of whom have connections with the Ramsey family. Confused over who was actually responsible for JonBenét's death, the reporter ultimately writes that the truth will only be discovered within time.","Alice Barrett-Mitchell as Reporter

She is drawn to the idea of becoming a call girl. With the aid of a prostitute named Yvonne, Eva learns the basics and then they both set out looking for janes and johns together. She meets a charming man who she falls in love with and goes to his house late at night for a romantic tryst.  He turns out to be a gigolo.  Consequently, they move into his penthouse, which is large enough for both of them to offer their services separately.
Eva gradually moves into the world of sado-masochism. She finds being a dominatrix extremely satisfying, and begins to take pleasure in controlling others and causing them intense pain. She discovers this in a scene in which a man is hiding under a table. Eva can see that his hands are sticking out from under the table and are clearly visible. Coldly, and with intense inner satisfaction, Eva proceeds to crush the man's hands by slowly walking over them with her stiletto-heeled shoes.
Chris, the gigolo, becomes jealous of her and wants to know what's going on upstairs and how she is making so much money.  She tells him it is from hurting men, and that the more she hurts them, the more money she gets. This upsets him greatly. She also becomes jealous of a boyfriend/client he has been seeing/servicing for many years. The scenes in the upstairs room intensify.  One day he sneaks up and observes her in a scene dominating a man tied to a chair. He has a look on his face like ""see, this is what you truly are,"" and the look on her face says proudly ""yes, this is what I truly am."" He tries to whisk her away from all of it, buying her furs, talking about marriage.  She tells him that she's been dreaming about hitting him, and in the dream he likes it.
The setting is all there for a romantic ending, and yet, he panics, he takes all their money and invests it in a restaurant that she doesn't want to be part of.  She tries to walk out on him, and he gets angry, throws her against the wall, hits her, pours alcohol on her, and lights her on fire.
But the last scene shows her unscathed, happy with her friend the sex worker/madame, and they're getting thrown out of a bar that Chris owns.",

Despite its title, the song is a march as opposed to a rag and contains little syncopation. The song is a narrative sequel to Berlin's earlier 1910 composition ""Alexander and His Clarinet"". This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander's innovative musical style. Berlin's friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.
Emma Carus, a famous contralto renowned for her high lung power, introduced Berlin's song to the public in Spring 1911. Carus' brassy performance of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" at the American Music Hall in Chicago on April 18, 1911, electrified the audience, and she toured other metropolises such as Detroit and New York City with acclaimed performances that featured the catchy tune. Carus' tour showcased the song in the United States and contributed to its immense popularity.
Amid the success of Carus' national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Soon after, Berlin's jaunty melody ""sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards,"" and it became ""the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912."" Although not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin's composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee—a belated celebration of the music which African-Americans had originated a decade prior in the 1890s. The positive international reception of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" led to a musical and dance revival known as ""the ragtime craze"". 
Nearly two decades later, singer Bessie Smith recorded a 1927 cover which became one of the hit songs of that year. The song's popularity re-surged in 1934 with the release of a close harmony cover by the Boswell Sisters, and a 1938 musical film of the same name starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye. A variety of artists covered the song such as Al Jolson, Billy Murray, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and others. The song had at least a dozen hit covers within fifty years of its release.

History
Composition and difficulties
In March 1911, the Ted Snyder Company in New York City employed the 23-year-old Irving Berlin as a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. One morning after arriving at work, Berlin decided to compose an instrumental ragtime number. By this time, the ragtime phenomenon popularized by pianist Scott Joplin and other African-American musicians had begun to wane, and over a decade had passed since the syncopated genre's initial heyday in the Gay Nineties.
A tireless workaholic, Berlin composed the piece while in the noisy offices of Ted Snyder's music publishing firm where ""five or six pianos and as many vocalists were making bedlam with songs of the day."" Berlin composed the lyrics of the song as a narrative sequel to his earlier 1910 composition ""Alexander and His Clarinet"". This earlier composition recounts the reconciliation between an African-American musician named Alexander Adams and his flame Eliza Johnson as well as highlights Alexander's innovative musical style. Berlin's friend Jack Alexander, a cornet-playing African-American bandleader, inspired the title character.
By the next day, Berlin completed four pages of notes for the copyist-arranger. Berlin registered the song in the name of the Ted Snyder Company as E252990 and published it on March 18, 1911. Upon playing the composition for others, listeners criticized the song as too lengthy (""running beyond the conventional 32 bars""), too rangy, and not ""a real ragtime number"". In fact, the tune is a march as opposed to a rag and barely contains a trace of syncopation. Its sole notability consists of quotes from Swanee River and a bugle call. Due to such criticisms, the tune unimpressed listeners at the Ted Snyder Company.

Undaunted by the lackluster response, Berlin submitted the song to Jesse L. Lasky, a Broadway theater producer planning an extravagant debut for his nightclub theater called the Follies Bergère. Lasky hesitated to incorporate the pseudo-ragtime number into his show. When the show opened on April 27, 1911, Lasky chose only to use its melody whistled by performer Otis Harlan. Thus the song failed to find an appreciative audience.
Fortunately for Berlin, vaudeville singer and baritone Emma Carus liked his humorous composition, and she introduced the song on April 18, 1911, at the American Music Hall in Chicago. She next embarked on a tour of the Midwest in Spring 1911. Consequently, music historians credit Carus for showcasing the song to the country and helping contribute to its immense popularity. In gratitude, Berlin credited Carus on the cover of the sheet music. The catchy song became indelibly linked with Carus in the public consciousness, although rival performers such as Al Jolson later co-opted the hit tune.

Amid the success of Carus' national tour, the comedic duo of Arthur Collins and Byron G. Harlan released a phonograph recording of the song on May 23, 1911, which became the best-selling record in the United States for ten consecutive weeks. Five days later, Berlin performed the song himself on May 28, 1911, in a special charity performance of the first Friars Frolic by the New York Friars Club at the New Amsterdam Theater. A fellow composer in attendance, George M. Cohan, instantly recognized the catchiness of the tune and told Berlin that the song would be an obvious hit. Soon after, Berlin's jaunty melody ""sold a million copies of sheet music in 1911, then another million in 1912, and continued to sell for years afterwards."" Alexander's Ragtime Band became ""the number one song from October 1911 through January 1912.""

Cultural sensation
Although neither Irving Berlin's first commercial hit nor his first composition to attract international attention, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band""  nevertheless catapulted Berlin's career. American newspapers hailed Berlin's jumpy tune as the decade's musical sensation, and he became a cultural luminary over night. An adoring international press subsequently touted him as the ""King of Ragtime"", an inaccurate title as the song ""had little to do with ragtime and everything to do with ragtime audacity, alerting Europe to hot times in the colonies."" Baffled by this new title, Berlin publicly insisted that he did not originate ragtime but merely ""crystallized it and brought it to people's attention."" Historian Mark Sullivan later claimed that, with the auspicious debut of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", Berlin abruptly ""lifted ragtime from the depths of sordid dives to the apotheosis of fashionable vogue.""
Although not a traditional ragtime song, Berlin's jaunty composition kickstarted a ragtime jubilee—a belated popular celebration of the musical style which African-American composers such as Scott Joplin had originated a decade earlier in the 1890s. The positive international reception of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" in 1911 led to a musical and dance revival known as ""the ragtime craze"". 

At the time, ragtime music caught ""its second wind"" and ragtime dancing spread ""like wildfire."" One dancing couple in particular who exemplified this faddish sensation were Vernon and Irene Castle. The charismatic, trendsetting duo frequently danced to Berlin's ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" and his other modernist compositions. The Castles' modern dancing paired with Berlin's modern songs came to embody the ongoing culture clash between the waning propriety of the Edwardian era and the waxing joviality of the Ragtime revolution on the eve of World War I. The Daily Express wrote in 1913 that:

In every London restaurant, park and theater, you hear [Berlin's] strains; Paris dances to it; Vienna has forsaken the waltz; Madrid has flung away her castanets, and Venice has forgotten her barcarolles. Ragtime has swept like a whirlwind over the earth.
Writers such as Edward Jablonski and Ian Whitcomb have emphasized the irony that, in the 1910s, even the upper class of the Russian Empire—a reactionary nation from which Berlin's Jewish forebears had been compelled to flee decades earlier—became enamored with ""the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania."" Specifically, British socialite Lady Diana Cooper described Prince Felix Yusupov, an affluent Russian aristocrat who married the niece of Tsar Nicholas II and later murdered Grigori Rasputin, as dancing ""around the ballroom like a demented worm"" and shouting, ""More ragtime!""
Hearing of such behavior, commentators diagnosed such individuals as ""bitten by the ragtime bug"" and behaving like ""a dog with rabies."" They declared that ""whether [the ragtime mania] is simply a passing phase of our decadent culture or an infectious disease which has come to stay, like la grippe or leprosy, time alone can show.""

Continued popularity
As the years passed, Berlin's ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" had many recurrent manifestations as many artists covered it:  Billy Murray, in 1912; Bessie Smith, in 1927; Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, in 1930; the Boswell Sisters, in 1934; Louis Armstrong, in 1937; Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell, in 1938; Johnny Mercer, in 1945; Al Jolson, in 1947; Nellie Lutcher, in 1948, and Ray Charles in 1959.  Consequently, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" had a dozen hit covers within the half-a-century prior to 1960.
Reflecting decades later upon the song's unlikely success, Berlin confessed his amazement at its immediate global acclaim and continued popularity. He ascribed its unexpected success to the farcical and silly lyrics which were ""fundamentally right"" and ""started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking.""
In 1937, 20th Century Fox  approached Irving Berlin to write a story treatment for an upcoming film tentatively titled Alexander's Ragtime Band. Berlin agreed to write a story outline for the film which featured twenty-six of Berlin's well-known musical scores. 

During press interviews promoting the film prior to its premiere, Berlin decried articles by the American press which painted ragtime as jazz's forerunner. Berlin stated: ""Ragtime really shouldn't be called 'the forerunner of jazz' or 'the father of jazz' because, as everyone will tell when they hear some of the old rags, ragtime and jazz are the same.""
Released on August 5, 1938, Alexander's Ragtime Band starring Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche became a smash hit and grossed in excess of five million dollars. Soon after the film's release, writer Marie Cooper Dieckhaus filed a plagiarism lawsuit. After Dieckhaus presented evidence at the trial, a federal judge ruled in Dieckhaus' favor that Berlin had stolen the plot of her unpublished 1937 manuscript and used many of its elements for the film. Dieckhaus had submitted the unpublished manuscript in 1937 to various Hollywood studios, literary agents, and other individuals for their perusal. The judge believed that, after rejecting her manuscript, Berlin nonetheless appropriated much of her work. In 1946, an appellate court reversed the ruling on appeal.

Alleged plagiarism
There are allegations that Berlin purloined the melody for ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" (in particular, the four notes of ""oh, ma honey"") from drafts of ""Mayflower Rag"" and ""A Real Slow Drag"" by prolific composer Scott Joplin. Berlin and Joplin were acquaintances in New York, and Berlin had opportunities to hear Joplin's scores prior to publication. At the time, ""one of Berlin's functions at the Ted Snyder Music Company was to be on the lookout for publishable music by other composers.""
Allegedly, Berlin ""heard Joplin's music in one of the offices, played by a staff musician (since Berlin could not read music) or by Joplin himself."" According to one account: 

Joplin took some music to Irving Berlin, and Berlin kept it for some time. Joplin went back and Berlin said he couldn't use [the song]. When ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" came out, Joplin said, ""That's my tune.""
Joplin's widow claimed that, ""after Scott had finished writing Treemonisha, and while he was showing it around, hoping to get it published, [Berlin] stole the theme, and made it into a popular song. The number was quite a hit, too, but that didn't do Scott any good."" A relative of John Stillwell Stark, Joplin's music publisher, asserted ""the publication of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' brought Joplin to tears because it was his [own] composition."" Joplin later died bankrupt after undertaking the financial burden of his unsuccessful Treemonisha opera and was buried in a pauper's grave (remaining unmarked for 57 years) in Queens, New York, on April 1, 1917. As writer Edward A. Berlin notes in King of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era:

There were also rumors heard throughout Tin Pan Alley to the effect that Alexander's Ragtime Band had actually been written by a black man, and even a quarter-century later [composer] W.C. Handy told an audience that ""Irving Berlin got all his ideas and most of his music from the late Scott Joplin."" Berlin was aware of the rumors and addressed the issue in a magazine interview in 1916.
For the next half-century, Berlin was incensed by the allegation that a ""'black boy'  [sic] had written 'Alexander's Ragtime Band'."" Responding to his detractors, Berlin stated: ""If a negro could write 'Alexander,' why couldn't I? ... If they could produce the negro and he had another hit like 'Alexander' in his system, I would choke it out of him and give him twenty thousands dollars in the bargain."" In 1914, Berlin referenced the allegation in the lyrics of his composition ""He's A Rag Picker."" The song features a verse in which a ""black character"" named Mose claims authorship of ""Alexander's Ragtime Band.""

Lyrical implications
Although the 1911 sheet music cover drawn by artist John Frew depicts the band's musicians as either white or biracial, Berlin's ""Alexander's Ragtime Band""—and his earlier 1910 composition ""Alexander and His Clarinet""—employ certain idiomatic expressions (""oh, ma honey"", ""honey lamb"") and vernacular English (""bestest band what am"") in the lyrics to indicate to the listener that the characters in the song should be understood to be African-American.
For example, an often-omitted and risqué second verse identifies the race of Alexander's clarinet player:

There's a fiddle with notes that screeches
Like a chicken—like a chicken—
And the clarinet is a colored pet.

Months after their stage debut, they now have a baby boy and no steady income, and Jim expresses little interest in finding work or supporting the family. After a fight with Sarah, Jim tries to get a loan from John Ashmore, a wealthy businessman, who denies his request, but mentions his envy at Jim's fatherhood, since his wife cannot bear children. On a whim, Jim enlists with the Marines for four years, and goes drinking. After returning home and quarreling again with Sarah, he disappears with their young son Bobby, intending to sell him to the Ashmores. The heartbroken Sarah is given a job singing with an itinerant musician, Cyril Belloc.
Two years later, Cyril and Sarah perform for WWI veterans in a hospital. As she goes among the beds of the wounded soldiers, she finds Jim there, near death. He begs forgiveness for his actions, and tells her about giving her son to the Ashmores. When she pleads with John Ashmore to let her see if their son is hers, Ashmore refuses, threatening to have her committed; their attorney, Howard Vanning, who is also Ashmore's brother-in-law, takes pity on her and says he will try to help, but also believes her delusional. Sarah leaves America for Germany to pursue her singing career.
Years later, Sarah has become an internationally famous opera singer, and returns to New York to perform. She reconnects with Vanning, declares she is no longer afraid of any threats the Ashmores can levy against her, and again demands to meet the boy, saying a birthmark will prove her is her son.

Still refusing to agree to a meeting, Mrs. Ashmore presents in his stead the deaf mute son of one of their servants, hoping this will convince Sarah he is not her son.

She fights and kills several of them but is overwhelmed. She is quickly tried and sentenced to death by hanging, but suddenly rescued by the mysterious Seishiro Kikui, head of Secret Police. Inside his headquarters, he propositions Yuki to spy on an ""enemy of the State"", the anarchist Ransui Tokunaga. Ransui is in possession of a critical document which Seishiro seems quite obsessed with, deeming it highly dangerous to the stability of the government. If Yuki can obtain and deliver the document to Seishiro, he will grant her immunity from her charges.
Yuki infiltrates Ransui's home posing as a maid, and sets about looking for the document. But the more she observes Ransui, the more she questions the path Seishiro has put her on. When Ransui confides in Yuki, knowing full well who she is, asking her to deliver the document to his brother Shusuke, Yuki will be forced to decide her allegiance.","Meiko Kaji as Yuki Kashima, Lady Snowblood

6631279,/m/0gffwj,Little city,,93.0,['english'],1997-04-04,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"In an AA support group, womanizing bartender Kevin is talking about how he thought his relationships with women would change after he stopped drinking. Kevin sees a woman he wants, but loses interest in her after he gets her. He realizes this is not a healthy relationship pattern but does not know how to change it.
Rebecca, a single woman new to the ""small town"" of San Francisco, applies for a bartender job at the same bar Kevin works at. Although Kevin comes onto Rebecca immediately, she recognizes Kevin's playboy ways and rebuffs him; however, the two become good friends. Adam, Kevin's friend who drives a cab to support himself while he pursues his passion for painting, confides in Kevin about his girlfriend Nina and his suspicions she is having an affair. When Adam tries to initiate sex with Nina later at home, she tells him she is tired. Quickly realizing he may become suspicious, Nina changes her mind and decides to sleep with him; although, unbeknownst to Adam, she has just come back from sleeping with her lover.
Kevin and Nina meet in a Catholic church where he tells her that Adam suspects she is cheating on him. Nina is alarmed and asks Kevin if Adam knows who her lover is. It is revealed Kevin is the man with whom she is cheating on Adam with, stemming form her feelings of being neglected by Adam. The two express guilt over deceiving Adam, but they also acknowledge they cannot stay away from each other. Nina also feels that Adam is not over his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who left him for another woman, Anne, after coming out as a lesbian.
Adam, figuring out Kevin is the man sleeping with Nina, confronts him at the bar where Kevin and Rebecca work. Kevin argues Adam was not treating Nina right and claims Adam is not truly in love with her because he has not gotten over his ex. Adam recognizes some truth in what Kevin says, but he still angrily smashes a shot glass against the bar wall before storming out.
Rebecca, being new in town and unlucky in love, meets Anne at a coffee shop. Even though she does not have a serious interest in being a lesbian, she decides to sleep with Anne to see if it excites her more than sleeping with men, which has so far been underwhelming for her. Her first lesbian experience with Anne is interrupted by Kate who returns home early after finally coming out of the closet to her parents. Catching Anne and Rebecca in bed together, Kate walks out. Rebecca, realizing she is not really a lesbian, does not see Anne again out of embarrassment.
Kate is left heartbroken by Anne's transgression. Anne, on the other hand, has been looking for a reason to break it off with Kate, who is the younger of the two and more serious about the relationship. Anne does not like the domestic routine the two have settled into and tells Kate that she has never been very good at monogamy.
After confronting Nina about her affair with Kevin, Adam and Nina break up. Learning Kate is no longer with Anne, Adam sees it as an opportunity to get back together with her, although she tells him it's not possible. Adam meets Rebecca when he picks her up in his cab on her way to a blind date. They recognize each other from his blow-up in the bar and are instantly attracted to each other. Although Rebecca warns Adam that she is not very comfortable with her own body and does not feel terribly connected to it in bed, Rebecca discovers sex with Adam is better than any experience she has had before.
With Nina and Adam's relationship over, Kevin tells Nina that their relationship was not only sex and that he's in love with her. Nina, knowing Kevin's past indiscretions of dumping women after he sleeps with them and loses interest, does not believe his declaration and tells him she does not want to see him again. Meanwhile, Adam and Rebecca are happy until Kate calls him and tells him she wants to get back together and wants him to father a child. He is initially angry with Kate, telling her that her timing is way off and he is now seeing someone else. After thinking it over, he regretfully breaks up with Rebecca to get back with Kate. Hurt, Rebecca tells Adam that she is the one that broke Kate and Anne up when Kate caught the two in bed, saying she supposes Adam leaving her makes her and Kate ""even"". She also tells Adam not to call her when Kate inevitably breaks his heart again.
Kate tries to settle into the rekindled relationship with Adam, but after realizing that she is more attracted to women, she breaks up with him again. However, instead of diving into another relationship, Kate has decided to stay single for now and try to get to know herself. Nina turns up pregnant, but does not know if the baby is Kevin's or Adam's because she slept with both of them in the same night. Kevin still professes his love for Nina, but she is still suspect of his true feelings. Adam finds out she is pregnant, but with the three of them not knowing whose child it is, everything is put on hold. Adam finally goes to Nina's place to have it out with her over who is the father of her baby. He finds Nina and Kevin there together, telling Adam that they have decided to get married. Adam is angry but acquiesces, seeing that Kevin really loves Nina. Nina tells both of them she does not want to know who the biological father of her child is and tells Adam that she and Kevin are going to raise the child. Rebecca, hearing about everything that happened from Kevin, and knowing that Adam would not call her, goes to see him, and the two resume their relationship.","Jon Bon Jovi as Kevin

The robot is controlled completely from the inventor's command center, and many robots similar to it are lined up along the walls of the lair. The front page of the Daily Planet reports the robot's robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of 50 million dollars of the world's rarest gems at the local museum.
Later, Clark Kent is covering the museum's exhibit for the Planet, though he is greeted by Lois Lane, who intends to cover the story as well. Another robot lands in the street outside, and when the police pelt it with machine gun fire as it marches towards the museum, the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the robot marches towards the jewels and begins loading them into an opening in its back. 

 While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois climbs into the robot's back, just as it leaves the museum and takes off into the sky. Clark emerges from the booth, notices Lois gone, and says, ""This is a job for Superman!"" He goes back into the phone booth and changes his clothes, emerging in his classic red-and-blue costume.
Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside with the jewels. He lands on it and struggles to open the door in its back, only to have the inventor maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a power line, tangling him in the wires. As the robot is upside down, the door flies open and all the jewels fall out in the process, with Lois surviving only by hanging for dear life until the robot flips back over.
As Superman struggles to free himself from the wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of jewels, the inventor finds Lois in its payload. Infuriated, he asks her what she did with the jewels, but she suggests that he ""read about it in tomorrow's papers"". The next time we see her, she is bound and gagged on a platform held over a pot of boiling metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry. The inventor pulls a lever which starts some machinery gradually lowering her closer and closer to the liquid.
Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the inventor's lair, only to meet the army of robots (numbers 1-9, 11, 13-17, 19-23, 25, and 27  are seen). Under the inventor's control, the robots emit fire from nozzles positioned on the lower part of their heads, encircle Superman, and pound him with their fists. Initially, the robots seem to have the upper hand, beating Superman to the ground, but Superman defeats them, sending the inventor running. When Superman catches up with him, he is holding a knife to the rope holding Lois's platform above the molten metal and threatens to cut it if he takes another step. Superman makes a move, the rope is cut, and Superman speeds across the room to catch Lois just in time, landing on a ledge below the pot of molten metal. The inventor then pulls a lever to dump the hot liquid on them, but Superman shields himself and Lois with his cape (which happens to be impervious to the hot liquid). The inventor, realizing that he has lost, attempts to commit suicide by jumping over a ledge, but Superman grabs him and flies from the lair to take both Lois and the inventor back to the city. The next issue of the Planet details that the robots are destroyed, the stolen jewels and money are recovered, and the inventor is imprisoned for the thefts. In the office, Clark says ""That's a wonderful story, Lois"". She replies, ""Thanks Clark, but I owe it all to Superman"". Clark smiles.","Bud Collyer as Clark Kent/Superman, Police Officer, Inventor

Their wealth and competitive advantage stem from the human capital of their employees and the intellectual property they produce. Corporations jealously guard their most valuable employees and go to great expense to keep them safe and happily productive. There is little point in traditional corporate espionage, as new technologies are developed so quickly that stolen secrets soon become obsolete. Instead, the field has now evolved to the point of enticing valuable employees to switch their loyalty from one company to another and arranging for their escape ― a highly dangerous endeavor, given the tight security in place around such individuals.
Two male free-lance agents, Fox and the unnamed narrator, have been hired by the Japanese firm Hosaka to bring genetic researcher Hiroshi Yomiuri over from Maas Biolabs GmbH, a German rival. They bring in a third associate, a woman named Sandii, to seduce Hiroshi and persuade him to defect. The narrator begins a relationship with Sandii as the three arrange for Hiroshi's move to a secret laboratory in Marrakech, purchased by the narrator with Hosaka funds. On the night before the transfer is to take place, the narrator spends time with Sandii and finds an unlabeled computer disk in her purse, but disregards it.
Fox, Sandii, and the narrator orchestrate Hiroshi's disappearance from a street in Vienna and spirit him away to the Marrakech lab. Hosaka pays the three and erases all evidence of having done business with them; the two men fly to Japan and part ways with Sandii. The company sends its top researchers to the lab to meet with Hiroshi, only for everyone there to die or suffer permanent brain damage in a sudden outbreak of disease. Hosaka wipes out the bank accounts of Fox and the narrator, cuts off their business connections, and sends assassins to kill them, blaming them for the deaths. The two men flee, realizing that Sandii had secretly defected to Maas and reprogrammed Hiroshi's equipment to release the virus. Fox falls to his death after being pushed off a mezzanine railing, while the narrator goes into hiding at the titular New Rose Hotel, a run-down capsule hotel.
One week later, the narrator is still there, contemplating suicide, pining for Sandii while berating himself for overlooking the disk and her treachery, and waiting for Hosaka forces to arrive. 
""New Rose Hotel"" presents a bleak future as extrapolated from contemporary economic and social trends. Set in the same period and universe as Gibson's Sprawl trilogy, it is solidly cyberpunk in its style and vision.",

After a failed attempt to chase and nab the duo, the officials draw up several plans to capture both. Police authorities strongly feel that Fernandez will go to Bangalore and may try to meet up with his only daughter, Gaadha. Unnikrishnan and Purushothaman Nair, two inspectors from Kerala Police, are sent to Bangalore to covertly observe Gaadha to see if Fernandez makes contact.
Upon reaching Bangalore, Unnikrishnan meets Peter, his college mate, who is also now an inspector with Karnataka Police. Unnikrishnan and Peter make up a team and sideline Purushothaman, who struggles to cope up with the Kannada language. The police team stay at an apartment opposite one where Gaadha lives. Gaadha  works at an advertisement agency as a copy writer and stays with Maggie aunty as a paying guest. Unnikrishnan and Peter are more interested in drinking, playing cards and having fun rather than investigating. Purushothaman tries to report this, but fails each time. Unnikrishnan slowly develops a crush on Gaadha. He tries to woo her in multiple ways, including befriending Maggie aunty. Eventually they become friends.
Meanwhile, the police find out that Fernandez is in the city and is in touch with Gaadha. Unnikrishnan decides to use Gaadha to reach out to Fernandez. Gaadha tells him about Fernandez's past, when he was a much loved college professor. He questions the college authorities on many administration malpractices, which made him their target. He rallies the students against the offenders who had political connections as well as the police commissioner on their side. In retaliation, professor Fernandez and a female student, Mercy, are brutally attacked one night after a college event. Mercy was raped and later committed suicide and the professor was falsely convicted in the case.
Unnikrishnan, with the  help of Gaadha, tries to convince the professor to give up his plans for revenge but is unable to do so. Meanwhile, Gaadha gets an opportunity to work abroad. She now reciprocates Unni's affection and even meets his mother. 
The professor starts his revenge by killing the sons of the commissioner and the MP and the dishonest lawyer, who had fabricated the evidence during the rape trial. He then decides to bomb the city stadium during a football match. Raghu, alarmed by the professors' deteriorating mental equilibrium, decides to leave but is killed. Fernandez plants the bomb in the stadium, but the police corner and trap him before he can set it off.  Unnikrishnan successfully defuses the bomb and saves the lives of thousands.
News of the bomb is leaked to the public and the professor escapes in the ensuing chaos. He then fatally stabs the MP, and is finally captured by the police. Unnikrishnan also rescues Gaadha from the police, who had captured her on the orders of the commissioner. To save her from the future actions of the commissioner, Unni and Gaadha decide to leave for Kerala together to get married. However, circumstances keep them apart and unable to communicate with each other.

Sasi, written by Rahi Masoom Raza, and starring Rajesh Khanna in the lead, supported by Smita Patil, Sabeeha, Tanuja, Shafi Inamdar, Satish Shah and Karan Shah. A remake of the director's own 1984 Malayalam film Kanamarayathu starring Mammootty, the story revolves around three characters played by Rajesh Khanna, Smita Patil and Sabeeha. The original film was written by prominent Malayalam writer P. Padmarajan and was loosely based on Jean Webster's 1919 novel Daddy-Long-Legs.  Anokha Rishta was the debut of Sabeeha, the daughter of actress Ameeta. The movie did average business on its release and recovered its costs. 20 years later same theme was seen in Nishabd and Cheeni Kum.

Synopsis
Anokha Rishta is the story of an unusual relationship between Mary and Robert Brown. Mary is a 19-year-old orphan and lives in an orphanage run by nuns. She scores 92.5% in her last year and is artistically talented. Until her adulthood, her school education was being sponsored by a philanthropist. Her sponsor, a rich old man whom she has never met, but has only corresponded with through the nuns, passes away, leaving her dreams of a college education in shambles. Though she has never met her sponsor, she is never given the name of that old man by Mother Superior, chief of the orphanage. Mother Superior is aware that Mary and the old man used to write to each other and that Mary respected and loved him a lot. That old deceased sponsor's son says he is not interested in funding the college education of Mary. Mother Superior then decides to find a new sponsor for her education, but since it would take a further month to find a new sponsor, by which time the admission process would be over in colleges, Mother decides to convince the old man's son. Mother Superior meets with his son Robert 'Bob' Brown to continue to sponsor her college education till the orphanage finds a solution to what Mary will do in future. 
Bob, who is now at the helm of his father's business, agrees to continue her sponsorship only after consulting his father's trusted aid Nasir Khan, who makes Robert go through files containing letters written by Mary to his father over the years. Mother Superior advises Mary that in the city college and city hostel, she would not tell any one that she is an orphan and that she must say her parents are staying in Dubai. Meanwhile, Bob also insists to Mother Superior that Mary should not be told of his uncle's death so that Mary keeps writing letters to him and he can read them compassionately and fulfill all her wishes. Bob does not know how Mary looks, but keeps receiving letters from Mary asking for new pens, new dresses, etc. Mother Superior tells Mary that she would not give away the mail address or the photo of her sponsor as the sponsor wants to keep it that way and that's why the actual sponsor never came to meet Mary in person, but Mary can still write letters to her sponsor and deliver it to Mother Superior, who will post it to his residence. Bob is a good looking bachelor, who is a rich businessman, aged above 40 and Mary falls in love with him after meeting him few times accompanying Sweary, a classmate of Mary and Bob's niece.
Mary does not know him by face. Also neither Bob's dad nor Bob know Mary's face. Alex introduces his brother Bill to  Bob, and on Bob's advice Bill starts working in his firm. Bill is immature and along with his friends makes a trip to a famous doctor Dr. Miss Padma Kapoor and he tells her he has a problem with his reproductive organ. Doctor Padma realises that this 20-something guy is lying and asks his real name. On knowing his real name, Padma asks Bill is he not the younger brother of Alex? Now Bill asks for forgiveness and runs away. Bill asks his sister-in-law about the life of Robert Brown and asks why when Alex has married, Bob is unmarried? Beena explains it to him saying he was in love with Doctor Padma, but the couple decided they won't go against their respective father's wishes and so till date both are unmarried. 
At Sweary's birthday party, Robert Bob notices that Mary is wearing the same things which he had sent to the girl in the orphanage, but does not read too much into this as Mary had told them her parents are in Dubai. In the same birthday party, Bill meets Mary and falls in love with her, but her heart has already fallen for Robert, still without knowing that he is her sponsor, and she rejects Bill each time he proposes to her. Meanwhile, Bill keeps facing trouble in the office while he is learning things on the job and faces taunts from Nasir Khan regularly. Bill gets dejected after numerous attempts to impress Mary fail and starts working sincerely in Bob's company as an employee. Mary, being madly in love with Robert without knowing that he himself is her sponsor and ""her uncle"", whom she writes to regularly and gets letters from, keeps on living in her dreamy world of a married life with Robert. Her problem is that she cannot share her feelings and mental agony (of not getting a positive response from Robert) with ""her uncle"" because all the incoming and outgoing letters of Mary are screened first by Mother Superior.
Meanwhile, Bill gets help and tips from Robert on how to win a young woman's heart. Bill tells Bob that he is in love with Mary. Alex and his wife are also happy that Bill has matured and fallen in love with a girl. Alex asks Bob to unite Bill and Mary. A picnic is arranged by Bob to which all are invited, but Bill does not turn up as he is angry with Mary and Mary comes to the picnic only to spend time with Bob. She proposes to Bob and Robert replies that had he got married at the right age he would have had a daughter of Mary's age. He explains to her that had Mary been of the age of say, 25–26 or if he himself had been of that age, this love affair could have worked out. Later Mary finds that Robert has no feelings for her. Bill confuses her by telling her that Robert and Dr. Padma were in love for a long time and that they knew each other since school days. But they couldn't marry because Robert's father and Padma's parents were opposed to their alliance as their religions were different. At that young age of 20–22 Bob's dad had given him two choices: either to stay with him and marry a girl from their Christian community or leave the house and marry Padma. Robert decided not to hurt his dad's sentiments and decided not to marry. Similarly, Padma had decided they would remain friends and concentrate only on their careers. Mary is extremely frustrated after hearing this and in a fit of rage goes to Padma and lies to her that she is pregnant with Robert's baby. Padma is shocked at this and goes to Bob's office and scolds him for his irresponsibility but Robert tells her that it was not him. He calls Mary to his office and shouts at her thinking that she is pregnant with Bill's baby and lied to the doctor that she was pregnant with his baby, but she tells him that she was lying to break them up and also to prove her love for him and tells him that she cannot live without him.
Then Mother Superior tells Robert that Mary was going to be sent to Italy to learn music and also that Mary was allowed to become a nun as Mary expressed a wish to become a nun to her. But as a last wish Mary wants to see her unknown sponsor before leaving for Italy. Mother Superior then asks Robert whether he would like to meet Mary and disclose he is the sponsor to Mary, to which Robert replies he would not like to meet her. Mary does not want be a nun out of her own choice, but only because Robert is adamant of not ever marrying Mary and this fact is hidden from Mother Superior. Finally, when Robert breaks her heart (in her own interest only) and she decides to become a nun, Mary writes a final letter to ""her uncle"" with a special and last request to the head of the orphanage to deliver it to him without opening it and reading its contents. Dr. Padma, knowing all these developments, tries to stop Mary, but she remains firm on her decision. Then Padma advises Robert that decisions should never be postponed. Padma says years ago both of them did not have the courage to take a decision and are unmarried, but now he should not repeat the same thing and so needs to take a decision in the best interests of Mary and so he should marry her. Finally the responsibility falls on the shoulders of Robert to do something to prevent Mary from taking this drastic step of becoming a Nun and that leads to the highly emotional and impressive climax. So as a final meeting she sees Robert and tells him about this and that she cannot see him any more. She also meets Bill and tells him everything including that she is an orphan and that she is going to be a nun and that she had lied that her parents were in Dubai and asks Bill to move on. Bill, however, still is willing to marry her but she tells him that she is in love with someone else and since that man did not accept her, she decided to become a nun. He insists her to tell him who he is and she tells him that it is Robert. Now Bill also gets desperate upon knowing this decision of hers. This results in a misunderstanding between Bob and Bill. At this piece of news, he goes to Robert's office and yells at him for what he did. Robert then, as soon as Mary is about to leave from the orphanage, comes there and tells Mother Superior that Mary is making the decision to be a nun unwillingly and that she is in love with Bob himself, though Bill loves Mary and that as the sponsor he would like to meet her. Bob reveals that he was the sponsor (her uncle) that was unknown to her for so long and comforts her and says that he wants her to marry Bill.

Before doing that, however, he returns home to Riverdale for his high school reunion and in an attempt to save his friend Pop Tate's diner.
Archie and company are all now in their early thirties, with the trials and tribulations one might expect to have happened to such as a group over the years:

Betty, a grade school teacher, has had problems finding permanent employment, and may or may not have relationship issues.
Veronica, having lived in France since graduation, has been married (and divorced) four times to very wealthy men.
Jughead, now a successful psychiatrist, is also divorced (although only once), and now has sole custody of a son named Jordan. Due to the divorce and other failed relationships, Jughead carries emotional baggage that manifests itself in a terrible fear of women. A running gag in the movie is Jughead's desperation to avoid seeing Big Ethel during his visit to Riverdale. This is played for laughs at the end when at the reunion it turns out that Big Ethel is no longer the gangly, awkward teenager she once was but is now a striking beauty and still has a crush on Jughead.
Moose and Midge have gotten married and become chiropractors. They also have a son, Max, who hits it off with Jordan.
Reggie is a successful gym owner and owns a car lot.
When Archie sees Betty and Veronica for the first time in fifteen years, all his old feelings for them come flooding back, threatening his engagement—and it doesn't help that the girls renew their pursuit of Archie, heedless of the fact that he has a fiancée. Meanwhile, Archie also tries to keep Reggie, helped along by an uncharacteristically menacing Mr. Lodge, from evicting Pop Tate from his soda shop, under the pretext of expanding his gym. Hiram Lodge doesn't want Archie near Veronica and still thinks they are wrong for each other. Archie ultimately saves the Chock'lit Shoppe, though he loses Pam  to Robert, who Betty dumps after growing sick of his bullying, and decides to stay in Riverdale. Archie and Pam break up and decide to stay in Riverdale where he belongs. Veronica, Betty, and Jughead decide to move back to Riverdale as well. Reggie sees the error of his ways and reconciles with his friends as they take a group photo along with Jordan by Pops.","Almost all of the characters in the movie are regular or recurring characters in the originating comics:

26878691,/m/0f400r,Mysterious Island,,100.0,['standard mandarin'],1982-01-01,['Hong Kong'],['Hong Kong'],,,"During the American Civil War, five Northern prisoners of war escape during the Siege of Richmond, Virginia, by hijacking a hydrogen-filled observation balloon.  The escapees are Cyrus Smith, a railroad engineer in the Union army (named Cyrus Harding in Kingston's translation); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short for Nebuchadnezzar); Bonadventure Pencroff, a sailor (who is addressed only by his surname; in Kingston's version, he is named Pencroft); his protégé and adopted son Harbert Brown (called Herbert in some translations); and the journalist Gedéon Spilett (Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus's dog ""Top"".a
After flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown island, described as being located at 34°57′S 150°30′W (Southern Pacific Ocean/Asian:Oceanian side), about 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) east of New Zealand and about 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) from Virginia. They name it ""Lincoln Island"" in honor of Abraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, nitroglycerin, iron, an electric telegraph, a cave home inside a stony cliff called ""Granite House"", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the ""Bonadventure"". They start to think of themselves as colonists rather than castaways.

During their stay on the island, the ""colonists"" endure bad weather and domesticate an orangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen deus ex machina, responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a dugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.
The group finds a message in a bottle directing them to rescue a castaway on nearby Tabor Island, who is none other than Tom Ayrton (from In Search of the Castaways). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.
Ayrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, narrowly evading death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton has been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts malaria but is saved by a box of quinine sulfate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds except for a little red spot on each of them.
The island is revealed to be Captain Nemo's hideout, and home port of the Nautilus. Having escaped the maelstrom at the end of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, the Nautilus sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man, Nemo returned the Nautilus to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the torpedo that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an ""electric gun"". On his death bed, Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a raja of the then-independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero Tippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failed Indian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to a desert island with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the Nautilus and adopted the new name of ""Captain Nemo"". Before he dies, Nemo gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Nemo's final words are ""God and my country!"" (""Independence!"", in Verne's original manuscript). The Nautilus is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.b
Afterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find shelter on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship Duncan, which had come to rescue Ayrton, but was redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to the United States they form a new colony in Iowa, financed with Nemo's gifts.",

2487170,/m/07h9zj,Troops,,10.0,['english'],1997-01-01,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the US Cavalry and the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery where a troop is a subunit comparable to an infantry company or artillery battery. Historically the remainder of the Royal Horse Artillery used the term troop in the same manner but they eventually aligned with the rest of the Royal Regiment of Artillery in referring to troops as subordinate to artillery batteries.
Troops is often used to refer to the other members of one's company or cause, but because of its military connotations, it conveys a particularly altruistic type of dedicated worker. Traditionally, troops refers to the soldiers in a military.
A cavalry soldier of private rank is called a ""trooper"" in many Commonwealth armies (abbreviated ""Tpr"", not to be confused with ""trouper"").  
A related sense of the term, troops refers to members of the military collectively, as in ""the troops""; see Troop (disambiguation).

Troops in various forces
Today, a troop is defined differently in different armed forces.
In the Australian Army a troop is the equivalent of a platoon sized element in units of certain corps, those being:

Australian Army Aviation
Royal Australian Armoured Corps
Royal Australian Corps of Signals
Royal Australian Corps of Transport
Royal Australian Engineers
Royal Australian Survey Corps (now disbanded)
Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery
Special Air Service Regiment (SASR)
The SASR is the only unit in the Royal Australian Infantry Corps to use the term troop to refer to its platoon-size elements. SASR troops are also unusual as they are commanded by a captain—most troop or platoon-sized elements are commanded by a lieutenant. In most cases, units which refer to platoon sized elements as troops refer to company-sized elements as squadrons and battalion-sized elements as regiments (regiments in the RAA use the term 'battery' for company-sized elements). Privates in the Royal Australian Armoured Corps and SASR hold the rank ""trooper"", however this is not the case for any other corps or units, which use the term troops.

In the British Army the definition of a troop varies by corps.

Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps: Three or four armoured fighting vehicles commanded by a subaltern, i.e. effectively the same level element as an infantry platoon. A unit of two to four guns or launchers, or an equivalent headquarters unit.
Royal Artillery: A half-battery. In the Royal Horse Artillery, a troop used to be the equivalent to a battery in other artillery units.
Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Logistic Corps, Special Air Service, and Honourable Artillery Company (and formerly the Royal Corps of Transport): A unit equivalent in size to a platoon in other corps, divided into sections or patrols. The Royal Engineers and Royal Corps of Signals used platoons instead until after World War II.
Other Army corps do not use the term.
In the Royal Marines, a troop is the equivalent to an Army platoon; a carryover from the organisation of the British Commandos in World War II.
In the Canadian Army, a troop is the equivalent of a platoon within the armoured, artillery, engineer, and signals branches.  Two to four troops comprise the main elements of a squadron.
In the United States Army, in the cavalry branch, a troop is the equivalent unit to the infantry company, commanded by a captain and consisting of three or four platoons, and are called a troop within a regiment. Companies were renamed troops in 1883. In some instances, an infantry company may be titled as a ""troop"" due to its presence in a cavalry squadron; this is typically the case for the dismounted reconnaissance troop (DRT) of a RSTA squadron, in which an infantry company-sized element is part of a cavalry-branched squadron.

Troops in civilian organizations
In the United States, state police forces are often regionally divided into troops. This usage came from these organizations modelling themselves on the US Army, and especially the older cavalry units. For this same reason the state police and highway patrol personnel of most states are known as ""troopers"" rather than ""officers"".
In Scouting, a scout troop is a unit made up of scouts or guides from the same locality under a leader. In the case of Guides, the term ""company"" is used more often, and was used by the founder in his first books about guiding.

25960460,/m/0b6kc_5,Daddy and Them,,101.0,['english'],2001-01-01,"['United States of America', 'Netherlands']","['United States of America', 'Netherlands']",,,"Daddy and Them is a 2001 American comedy-drama film written, directed by, and starring Billy Bob Thornton. In addition to Thornton, it stars John Prine, Laura Dern, Andy Griffith, Ben Affleck, Kelly Preston, Diane Ladd, Brenda Blethyn, Tuesday Knight, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jim Varney in his final film appearance before his death in February 2000.
Daddy and Them was filmed in 1998 in the wake of Thornton’s success with Sling Blade and was originally planned as a theatrical release. The release was ultimately delayed by Miramax, who found the film not ""commercial"" enough. The film debuted at the Newport International Film Festival on June 6, 2001. Miramax eventually aired the film on Showtime in January 2003 and released it on DVD on January 13, 2004.

Plot synopsis
Ruby and Claude Montgomery are a very insecure and jealous couple who must reunite with extended family in Arkansas when Claude's Uncle Hazel is jailed for attempted murder. The couple travels with Ruby's older sister Rose, with whom Claude had a previous relationship, and Ruby and Rose's mother Jewel, who continuously talks about Rose and Claude's past relationship, which irritates Ruby.

Cast
Production
The film was shot in Arkansas from August to October 1998. Filming locations included various sites around Little Rock, including Pinnacle Mountain State Park and the interior of the Arkansas State Capitol.
The song from the same-titled album ""In Spite of Ourselves"" used during the closing credits was performed by John Prine and Iris DeMent.

Release
Daddy and Them initially had a theatrical release date planned for sometime in late 1999 or early 2000. The release date was pushed back as Miramax wanted All the Pretty Horses, a studio film Thornton was directing at the time, to debut first. It continued to sit on the shelf long after Horses premiered in late 2000. Thornton has commented that friction with Miramax during the production of Horses played a role in the shelving of Daddy and Them.
The film had its world premiere at the Newport International Film Festival on June 6, 2001.

Reception
Daddy and Them holds an 86% rating based on 7 reviews on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.
Eddie Cockrell of Variety wrote, ""Beneath its deadpan and often absurdist exterior, Daddy and Them feels like a very personal piece of work about how family really does come first, warts and all."" Brad Slager of Film Threat was more critical, writing, ”Plotless and pedantic, Daddy and Them is supposed to be a lighthearted look at family dysfunction in the Deep South, but the characters are not enjoyable enough to care about.""

One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is thrown out of an aeroplane by a pilot and falls to the ground unbroken. Initially, Xi's people assume the bottle to be a gift from their gods, just as they believe plants and animals are, and find many uses for it. Unlike other gifts, however, there is only one glass bottle, which causes unforeseen conflict within the tribe. As a result, Xi decides to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and dispose of the divisive object.
Along the way, Xi encounters biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the local wildlife; Steyn's assistant and mechanic, M'pudi; Kate Thompson, a woman who quit her job as a journalist in Johannesburg to become a village school teacher; and eventually a band of fugitive guerrillas led by Sam Boga. In the fictitious state Biryani, northwest of Botswana, Boga's men have killed three cabinet members and injured two others in an attempt on the president's life, sending the military in hot pursuit.
Steyn is tasked with bringing Thompson to the village where she will teach, but he is awkward and clumsy around her. Their Land Rover stalls while trying to ford a deep river; he hoists it out with a winch, but it continues lifting the vehicle to a very high treetop level while a forgetful Steyn is distracted extricating Thompson from a wait-a-bit tree. She more than once mistakes his attempts to evade wild animals, and putting out an evening campfire, as advances towards her. Eventually, a snobbish safari tour guide named Jack Hind arrives and takes Thompson the rest of the way to the village.
One day, Xi happens upon a herd of goats and shoots one with a tranquilizer arrow, planning to eat it. He is arrested and sentenced to jail. M'pudi, who once lived with the San and can speak the San language, is discontent with the verdict. He and Steyn arrange to hire Xi as a tracker for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison time, and teach Xi how to drive Steyn's Land Rover. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Thompson's school, taking her and the students as hostages as they make their escape to a neighbouring country.
Steyn, M'pudi and Xi, immersed in their fieldwork, find that they are along the terrorists' and children's path, and observe their movements with a telescope. They manage to immobilize six of the eight guerrillas using makeshift tranquilizer darts launched by Xi with a miniature bow, allowing Thompson and the children to confiscate the guerillas' firearms. Steyn and M'pudi apprehend the remaining two guerrillas by frightening one with a snake and by shooting at a tree above the other, causing latex to drip from the tree and irritate his skin. Jack Hind arrives and takes Thompson and the children away, taking credit for the rescue that Steyn, M'pudi and Xi had actually planned and executed.
Later, with Xi's term over, Steyn pays his wages and sends him on his way. Having never seen money before, Xi discards it. Steyn and M'pudi then drive from their camp to visit Thompson, where Steyn attempts to explain his tendency to be uncoordinated in her presence, but accidentally and repeatedly knocks over a number of objects in the process. Thompson finds his efforts endearing, and kisses Steyn.
Xi eventually arrives at the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. Convinced that he has reached the edge of the world, he throws the bottle off the cliff and returns to his family.",Director Jamie Uys appears in an uncredited role as the Reverend.

He is fascinated by the fact that she moans silently, involuntarily orgasms, but does not cry out or let people know she is being sexually molested. When Hada is transferred to Los Angeles, he has too much to drink at a business party and tries to imitate what he saw by groping a Caucasian school girl while riding a crowded bus. But unlike the Japanese woman that Hada saw in Japan, the American girl screams. Hada runs away, but is robbed and beaten by a mugger. Meanwhile, several innocent Asian men are beaten by bystanders who suspect that one of them is the man who groped the girl.
The girl happens to be Rita Crowe, the daughter of an LAPD vice-squad detective, Lt. Crowe, an officer with a strong sense of justice who is very protective of her. Shortly afterward, Fumiko, Hada's daughter, is kidnapped into a child prostitution ring led by the infamous ""Pimp King"" Duke. Crowe, who has developed a general dislike of the Japanese due to his daughter's incident, is assigned against his will to find the girl. His feelings about Japanese people start to change when he realizes that the Hadas care about their daughter as intensely as he cares for his daughter.
Crowe and his partner, Eddie Rios, eventually find Fumiko and rescue her from the pimp and his gang. They kill one member of the gang, but the others escape. The Hadas visit Crowe's house with gifts to show their appreciation for his work. Rita recognizes Hiroshi as the man who groped her on the bus—and he recognizes her—but neither one says anything. However, despite this apparently happy ending, Fumiko has been so traumatized by her experiences as a prostitute—she was raped by Duke and his gang members and then sold to customers of both sexes—that she commits suicide by an overdose.
Crowe and Rios decide to find Duke, and locate him on a boat in a harbor. In the ensuing fight, Duke and his remaining gang members kill Rios, but Duke eventually ends up in the harbor. Since Duke can't swim, Crowe has the option to let the gangster drown, but ends up dragging him out. However, as a way of ""poetic justice"", Crowe has Duke interned in a prison wing inhabited by sexually aggressive inmates; his designated cellmate makes several sexual allusions, leading Duke to realize that he is intent on raping him.

11633165,/m/02rm6l8,Innocence,,110.0,['turkish'],1997-01-01,['Turkey'],['Turkey'],,,"Innocence is a lack of guilt, with respect to any kind of crime, or wrongdoing. In a legal context, innocence is the lack of legal guilt of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

In relation to knowledge
Innocence can imply lesser experience in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale. In contrast to ignorance, it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of wrongdoing stems from a lack of knowledge, whereas wrongdoing comes from a lack of knowledge in children. Subjects such as crime and sexuality may be especially considered. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology explaining ""innocent"" as meaning ""not knowing"" (Latin noscere — to know, learn). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix in- and the Latin nocere, ""to harm"".
People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior. From this meaning comes the usage of innocent as a noun to refer to a child under the age of reason, or a person, of any age, who is severely mentally disabled. 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau described ""childhood as a time of innocence"" where children are ""not-knowing"" and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, as technology advances, children in the contemporary world have a platform where they are referred to as ""digital natives"", where they appear to be more knowledgeable in some areas than adults.

Pejorative meaning
""Innocence"" can have a pejorative meaning, in cases where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience. Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's, innocence is often also used to imply naivety or lack of experience.

Symbolism
The lamb is a commonly used symbol of innocence. In Christianity, for example, Jesus is referred to as the ""Lamb of God"", thus emphasizing his sinless nature. Other symbols of innocence include children, virgins, acacia branches (especially in Freemasonry), non-sexual nudity, songbirds, and the color white (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).

Loss of innocence
A ""loss of innocence"" is a common theme in fiction, pop culture, and realism. It is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain, and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like ""American Pie"", poetry like William Blake's collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience, novels like To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, A Farewell to Arms, and Lord of the Flies, and films like Viridiana, The 400 Blows, and Stand By Me.
By contrast, the I Ching urges a recovery of innocence –  the name given to Hexagram 25 –  and ""encourages you to actively practice innocence"".
Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the ""loss"" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stem from this discourse.

In psychoanalysis
The psychoanalytic tradition is broadly divided between those (like Fairbairn and Winnicott) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or psychological trauma; and those (like Freud and Klein) who saw the child as developing innocence — maturing into it — as a result of surmounting the Oedipus complex and/or the depressive position.
More eclectically, Eric Berne saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the clichés of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and ""the sweet phrases of charming innocence"". Christopher Bollas used the term ""Violent Innocence"" to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint — something akin to what he calls ""the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition"".

Literary sidelights
In Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook, a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the ""woman-in-love"".
Ivy Compton-Burnett had one character conclude dourly of another two that ""you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives"".

Hamsun's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to consciousness, subject, perspective and environment. He published more than 23 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, works of non-fiction and some essays.
Hamsun is considered to be ""one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years"" (ca. 1890–1990). He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Maxim Gorky, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Hermann Hesse, John Fante, James Kelman, Charles Bukowski and Ernest Hemingway. Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun ""the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect—his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his lyricism. The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun"". Since 1916, several of Hamsun's works have been adapted into motion pictures. On 4 August 2009, the Knut Hamsun Centre was opened in Hamarøy Municipality.
The young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism. He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the ""whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow"". Hamsun is considered the ""leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century"", with works such as Hunger (1890), Mysteries (1892), Pan (1894), and Victoria (1898). His later works—in particular his ""Nordland novels""—were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour. Hamsun only published one poetry collection, The Wild Choir, which has been set to music by several composers.
Hamsun had strong anti-English views, in part due to the treatment of Norway during World War I, and openly supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, travelling to meet Hitler during the German occupation of Norway. Due to his professed support for the occupation of Norway and the Quisling regime, he was charged with treason after the war. He was not convicted, officially due to psychological problems and issues relating to old age, but was issued a heavy fine in 1948. Hamsun's last book, On Overgrown Paths, authored in semi-imprisonment in Landvik, concerned his treatment and rebuttal of accusations of his mental ineptness.

Biography
Early life
Knut Hamsun was born as Knud Pedersen in Lom, Norway in the Gudbrandsdal valley. He was the fourth son (of seven children) of Tora Olsdatter and  Peder Pedersen.  When he was three, the family moved to Hamsund in Hamarøy Municipality in Nordland county. They were poor and an uncle had invited them to farm his land for him.
At nine Knut was separated from his family and lived with his uncle Hans Olsen, who needed help with the post office he ran. Olsen used to beat and starve his nephew, and Hamsun later stated that his chronic nervous difficulties were due to the way his uncle treated him.
In 1874 he finally escaped back to Lom. For the next five years he did any job for money; he was a store clerk, peddler, shoemaker's apprentice, sheriff's assistant, and an elementary-school teacher.
At 17 he became a ropemaker's apprentice; at about the same time he started to write. He asked businessman Erasmus Zahl to give him significant monetary support, and Zahl agreed. Hamsun later used Zahl as a model for the character Mack appearing in his novels Pan (1894), Dreamers (1904), Benoni (1908) and Rosa (1908).
He spent several years in America, traveling and working at various jobs, and published his impressions under the title Fra det moderne Amerikas Aandsliv (1889).

Early literary career
Working all those odd jobs paid off, and he published his first book: Den Gaadefulde: En Kjærlighedshistorie fra Nordland (The Enigmatic Man: A Love Story from Northern Norway, 1877). It was inspired from the experiences and struggles he endured from his jobs.
In his second novel Bjørger (1878), he attempted to imitate Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's writing style of the Icelandic saga narrative. The melodramatic story follows a poet, Bjørger, and his love for Laura. This book was published under the pseudonym Knud Pedersen Hamsund. This book later served as the basis for Victoria: En Kærligheds Historie (1898; translated as Victoria: A Love Story, 1923).
As of 1898 Hamsun was among the contributors of Ringeren, a political and cultural magazine established by Sigurd Ibsen.

Major works
Hamsun first received wide acclaim with his 1890 novel Hunger (Sult). The semiautobiographical work described a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of Kristiania (modern name Oslo). To many, the novel presages the writings of Franz Kafka and other twentieth-century novelists with its internal monologue and bizarre logic.
A theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities. This wanderer theme is central to the novels Mysteries, Pan, Under the Autumn Star, The Last Joy, Vagabonds, Rosa, and others.
Hamsun's prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline. For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as pantheism (""No one knows God,"" he once wrote, ""man knows
only gods.""). Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond. This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels Pan, A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings, and the epic Growth of the Soil, ""his monumental work"" credited with securing him the Nobel Prize in literature in 1920.

World War II, arrest and trial
During World War II, Hamsun supported the German war effort. He courted and met with high-ranking Nazi officers, including Adolf Hitler. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote a long and enthusiastic diary entry concerning a private meeting with Hamsun; according to Goebbels, Hamsun's ""faith in German victory is unshakable"". In 1940 Hamsun wrote that ""the Germans are fighting for us"". After Hitler's death, he published a short obituary in which he described him as ""a warrior for mankind"" and ""a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations"".
After the war, he was detained by police on 14 June 1945, for treason, then committed to a hospital in Grimstad (Grimstad sykehus) ""due to his advanced age"", according to Einar Kringlen (a professor and medical doctor). In 1947 he was tried in Grimstad and fined. Norway's supreme court reduced the fine from 575,000 to 325,000 Norwegian kroner.
After the war, Hamsun's views on the Germans during the war were a cause of serious grief for the Norwegians, and they tried to separate their world-famous writer from his Nazi beliefs. At the trial Hamsun had pleaded ignorance. Deeper explanations involve his contradictory personality, his distaste for hoi polloi, his inferiority complex, a profound distress at the spread of indiscipline, antipathy toward the interwar democracy, and especially his Anglophobia.

Death
Knut Hamsun died on 19 February 1952, aged 92, in Grimstad. His ashes are buried in the garden of his home at Nørholm in Grimstad Municipality.

Legacy
Thomas Mann described him as a ""descendant of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche."" Arthur Koestler was a fan of his love stories. H. G. Wells praised Markens Grøde (1917) for which  Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Isaac Bashevis Singer was a fan of his modern subjectivism, use of flashbacks, his use of fragmentation, and his lyricism. A character in Charles Bukowski's book Women referred to him as the greatest writer who has ever lived.
A fifteen-volume edition of Hamsun's complete works was published in 1954. In 2009, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, a new 27-volume edition of his complete works was published, including short stories, poetry, plays, and articles not included in the 1954 edition. For this new edition, all of Hamsun's works underwent slight linguistic modifications in order to make them more accessible to contemporary Norwegian readers. Fresh English translations of two of his major works, Growth of the Soil and Pan, were published in 1998.
Hamsun's works remain popular. In 2009, a Norwegian biographer stated, ""We can’t help loving him, though we have hated him all these years ... That’s our Hamsun trauma. He’s a ghost that won’t stay in the grave.""
Three of Hamsun's homes (Hamsund gård in Hamarøy Municipality, Hamsunstugu in Garmo in Lom Municipality, and Nørholm in Grimstad Municipality) are open to the public as museums, in addition to the Knut Hamsun Centre in Hamarøy.
The whereabouts of Hamsun's Nobel Prize medal remain unknown.

Writing techniques
Along with August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen, and Sigrid Undset, Hamsun formed a quartet of Scandinavian authors who became internationally known for their works. Hamsun pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, as found in material by, for example, Joyce, Proust, Mansfield and Woolf. His writing also had a major influence on Franz Kafka.

Personal life
In 1898, Hamsun married Bergljot Göpfert (née Bech), who bore daughter Victoria, but the marriage ended in 1906. Hamsun then married Marie Andersen (1881–1969) in 1909 and she was his companion until the end of his life. They had four children: sons Tore and Arild and daughters Ellinor and Cecilia.
Marie wrote about her life with Hamsun in two memoirs. She was a promising actress when she met Hamsun but ended her career and traveled with him to Hamarøy. They bought a farm, the idea being ""to earn their living as farmers, with his writing providing some additional income"".
After a few years they decided to move south, to Larvik. In 1918 they bought Nørholm, an old, somewhat dilapidated manor house between Lillesand and Grimstad. The main residence was restored and redecorated. Here Hamsun could occupy himself with writing undisturbed, although he often travelled to write in other cities and places (preferably in spartan housing).

Racism and admiration for Hitler
From his youth onward, Hamsun espoused anti-egalitarian and racist beliefs. In The Cultural Life of Modern America (1889), he expressed his firm opposition to miscegenation: ""The Negros are and will remain Negros, a nascent human form from the tropics, rudimentary organs on the body of white society. Instead of founding an intellectual elite, America has established a mulatto studfarm.""
Hamsun wrote several newspaper articles in the course of the Second World War, including his notorious 1940 assertion that ""the Germans are fighting for us, and now are crushing England's tyranny over us and all neutrals"". In 1943, he sent Germany's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels his Nobel Prize medal as a gift. His biographer Thorkild Hansen interpreted this as part of the strategy to get an audience with Hitler. Hamsun was eventually invited to meet with Hitler; during the meeting, he complained about the German civilian administrator in Norway, Josef Terboven, and asked that imprisoned Norwegian citizens be released, enraging Hitler. Otto Dietrich describes the meeting in his memoirs as the only time that another person was able to get a word in edgeways with Hitler. He attributes this to Hamsun's deafness. Regardless, Dietrich notes that it took Hitler three days to get over his anger. Hamsun also on other occasions helped Norwegians who had been imprisoned for resistance activities and tried to influence German policies in Norway.
Nevertheless, a week after Hitler's death, Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him, saying “He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations.” Following the end of the war, angry crowds burned his books in public in major Norwegian cities and Hamsun was confined for several months in a psychiatric hospital.
Hamsun was forced to undergo a psychiatric examination, which concluded that he had ""permanently impaired mental faculties,"" and on that basis the charges of treason were dropped. Instead, a civil liability case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay a ruinous sum to the Norwegian government of 325,000 kroner ($65,000 or £16,250 at that time) for his alleged membership in Nasjonal Samling and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation. Whether he was a member of Nasjonal Samling or not and whether his mental abilities were impaired is a much debated issue even today. Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party. He wrote his last book Paa giengrodde Stier (On Overgrown Paths) in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities. In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his own words, proves that he is not mentally ill.
The Danish author Thorkild Hansen investigated the trial and wrote the book The Hamsun Trial (1978), which created a storm in Norway. Among other things Hansen stated: ""If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway,"" as he felt that such treatment of the old Nobel Prize-winning author was outrageous. In 1996, Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell based the movie Hamsun on Hansen's book. In Hamsun, Swedish actor Max von Sydow plays Knut Hamsun; his wife Marie is played by Danish actress Ghita Nørby.

Studies on Hamsun's writings
Hamsun's writings have been the subject of numerous books and journal articles. Some of these writings explore the dialectic between Hamsun's literary works and his political and cultural leanings expressed in his non-fiction.
Hamsun produced a voluminous correspondence during his lifetime. Norwegian scholar and Hamsun expert Harald Næss spent four decades tracking these letters down in both the United States and Europe, producing a collection of thousands of letters. He would publish a selection in various volumes between 1994 and 2000.

Film and TV adaptations
Prime among all of Hamsun's works adapted to film is Hunger, a 1966 film starring Per Oscarsson. It is still considered one of the top film adaptations of any Hamsun works. Hamsun's works have been the basis of 25 films and television mini-series adaptations, starting in 1916.
The book Mysteries was the basis of a 1978 film of the same name (by the Dutch film company Sigma Pictures), directed by Paul de Lussanet, starring Sylvia Kristel, Rutger Hauer, Andrea Ferreol and Rita Tushingham.
Landstrykere (Wayfarers) is a Norwegian film from 1990 directed by Ola Solum.
The Telegraphist is a Norwegian movie from 1993 directed by Erik Gustavson. It is based on the novel Dreamers (Sværmere, also published in English as Mothwise).
Pan has been the basis of four films between 1922 and 1995. The latest adaptation, the Danish film of the same name, was directed by Henning Carlsen, who also directed the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish coproduction of the 1966 film Sult from Hamsun's novel of the same name.
Remodernist filmmaker Jesse Richards has announced he is in preparations to direct an adaptation of Hamsun's short story The Call of Life.

Cinematized biography
A biopic, Hamsun, was released in 1996, directed by Jan Troell. It stars Max von Sydow as Hamsun.

12053509,/m/02vn81r,Loverboy,3960327.0,98.0,['english'],1989-04-28,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Loverboy is a Canadian rock band formed in Calgary, Alberta in 1979. Loverboy's hit singles, particularly ""Turn Me Loose"" and ""Working for the Weekend"", have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock and classic hits radio stations across Canada and the United States. 
After being rejected by many American record labels, Loverboy signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording the debut album on March 20, 1980. Founding members were lead singer Mike Reno (previously with Moxy as Mike Rynoski), guitarist Paul Dean (previously with Scrubbaloe Caine and Streetheart), keyboardist Doug Johnson, bassist Jim Clench (replaced after one gig by Scott Smith) and drummer Matt Frenette.
Throughout the 1980s, Loverboy accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. Except for a brief breakup from 1988 to 1991, the band has continued to perform live shows regularly. They are currently based in Vancouver.

History
1979–1983
According to Reno, their name was chosen due to a dream by Paul Dean. He had come up with the name after spending the previous night with some of the bandmates, including Reno and their girlfriends, before going to the movies. The girlfriends were browsing through fashion magazines, where the guys in the band saw a Cover Girl advertisement. Cover Girl became Cover Boy, and then became Loverboy in Dean's dream later that night. After being told by Dean about the dream the next morning, Reno agreed to try it out and it stuck. 
Dean's manager, Lou Blair, then brought in the biggest rock manager in Canada at that time, Bruce Allen, who took on the band and arranged for them to make their live debut opening for Kiss at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C., on November 19, 1979.
Originally rejected by all the major record labels in the United States, the band signed with Columbia Records of Canada, and on March 20, 1980, Loverboy went into the studio with producer Bruce Fairbairn and engineer Bob Rock to record what would be its self-titled debut album.
Over that summer, the record became a huge hit with eventually over one million records sold in Canada alone. The album made its American debut in November 1980, and went on to sell over two million copies in the US. The band went on a touring spree that year putting on over 200 shows with bands such as Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, Kansas and Def Leppard. Their debut single, ""Turn Me Loose"", went on to hit No. 7 on the Canadian charts and No. 35 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in early 1981. ""The Kid Is Hot Tonite"" was also a single.
The band's follow-up album, Get Lucky, released in October 1981 when it was opening for Journey, included the hit tracks ""Working for the Weekend"", ""When It's Over"" and ""Lucky Ones"".  It became the group’s best selling album in the U.S., reaching No. 7 on the Billboard album charts and selling over four million copies. In the same year Loverboy received six Juno Awards (Canada's highest award for music) in one year, a record that still stands today.
Loverboy released its third album, Keep It Up, in June 1983. Its first single ""Hot Girls in Love"" became their most successful to that date, reaching No. 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The video for the song as well as for the follow-up single ""Queen of the Broken Hearts"" were hugely popular on MTV.

1984–1989
In 1984 Loverboy recorded the United States Team theme for the 1984 Summer Olympics, ""Nothing's Gonna Stop You Now"". The song originally appeared on The Official Music of the 1984 Games but not on any of its albums or compilations to date. The band would often play it on tour mixing it in during the performance of ""Queen of the Broken Hearts"".
Also in 1984, Loverboy recorded a song called ""Destruction"" which appeared on the 1984 soundtrack of a re-edited version of the film Metropolis (1927).
Lovin' Every Minute of It, the band's fourth album and first not produced by Fairbairn (it was produced by Tom Allom, best known for producing Judas Priest), was released in August 1985, with the title single written by Mutt Lange and ""This Could Be the Night"" co-written by Journey's Jonathan Cain becoming their first and second U.S. Billboard top 10 hits respectively.
In 1986 the band recorded ""Heaven in Your Eyes"", a song featured in the movie Top Gun, which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts. Keyboardist Doug Johnson refused to appear in the video as he felt that the film glorified war, which he opposed.
The release of Wildside, the band's fifth album, followed in September 1987. While it scored a minor hit with ""Notorious"", co-written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, the album sold relatively poorly and the band broke up in 1988 due to tensions between Dean and Reno.
Dean released a solo album, Hardcore, in May 1989 and a Loverboy greatest-hits album, Big Ones, was released later that same year, in October, to fulfill Loverboy's obligation to Columbia Records. The group briefly reunited in late 1989 to tour (with Geraldo Valentino Dominelli on keyboards filling in for Johnson) to promote it, but broke up again at the tour's conclusion.

1991–1999
On October 6, 1991, the band reunited again to join fellow rockers Bryan Adams, Colin James, Chrissy Steele and Bill Henderson of Chilliwack at a benefit show at Vancouver's 86 Street Music Hall to raise over $50,000 for Henderson's former bandmate, Brian MacLeod, who was fighting cancer and undergoing treatment at a Houston medical clinic. The band members reportedly recalled that the concert was the most fun that they had had in years and decided that they wanted to do it again. They went on another live touring spree in Canada the following year before launching a 64-concert tour in the United States in 1993.
The band's record label released its second and third compilation albums, Loverboy Classics and Temperature's Rising, in 1994.  Loverboy Classics went Gold by 1998, coinciding with another American tour. This was followed by the releases of Six and Super Hits in 1997.
Keyboardist Richard Sera came on to fill in for Johnson in December 1996 through 1997.

2000–2009: Death of Scott Smith
The band continued touring until November 30, 2000, when bassist Scott Smith was presumed dead after being washed overboard by a large wave while sailing in San Francisco Bay. He was 45 years old.
The band went on to release a live album, Live, Loud and Loose, in 2001, which consisted of refurbished early live concert recordings from the band's intense touring years from 1982 to 1986. The year 2001 also brought another round of touring, this time dedicated to Scott Smith. Ken ""Spider"" Sinnaeve, a former member of The Guess Who, Red Rider and Dean and Frenette's pre-Loverboy band Streetheart, joined the band on bass prior to the tour.
Loverboy celebrated 25 years together in 2005 and began to perform in selected cities to commemorate this milestone. That tour continued with live concerts scheduled well into August 2006. Also in 2005, Loverboy was one of the featured bands on the American version of Hit Me, Baby, One More Time. It performed ""Working for the Weekend"" and a cover version of ""Hero"" by Enrique Iglesias on the show.
In 2006, twenty-five years after its initial release, Get Lucky was remastered and re-released with several previously unreleased songs, including the original demo of ""Working for the Weekend"".
In a video interview from March 2007, Mike Reno confirmed that the band finished recording a new studio album released in 2007. Titled Just Getting Started, it was released in October, with a clip of the first single ""The One That Got Away"" available on the band's MySpace page. The band continues to tour throughout Canada and the United States.
The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame during the 2009 Juno Awards.

2010–2019
On February 21, 2010, the band performed at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics awards ceremony.
In June 2012 the band announced its album Rock 'n' Roll Revival would be released by Frontiers Records. The band was on tour with Journey and Pat Benatar/Neil Giraldo from July 24 to November 16, 2012. It finished up 2012 on the same tour when Night Ranger took up the reins to replace Benatar.
In 2013 Loverboy toured on and off for at least a few dates during every month, except for the month of March.
While continuing to tour in 2014, it was announced on the official Loverboy home page on June 19, 2014, that the band's newest album of all-original material, Unfinished Business, was expected to be released on July 15, 2014. The first single was already available for purchase on iTunes and the title of this song was ""Countin' the Nights"". The band toured during that summer, including at least two free shows.
In 2016 the band released two new singles, ""Hurtin'"" and ""Some Like It Hot"", the latter is described by Paul Dean as ""the first and only shuffle Loverboy has ever done"", comes from the same late '70s period as several of the songs found on their previous album, 2014's Unfinished Business. ""Giving it all away/Living for today,"" sings Mike Reno on the track – which originated as a demo, but was later rearranged and augmented by Dean, describing this latest as a ""gift"" from the band to its fans.
Dean went through more than 230 individual two-inch analog tapes he had transferred to digital, including this ""gem"" from the band's storied history. It follows the release of ""Hurtin'"" earlier this year. ""The beauty of the Internet is the ability to make a song available right away, without waiting until you have the rest of the album done,"" says Dean. ""It's a real boon to creativity. It's total grass roots, DIY. Like the lyrics to 'Some Like It Hot', we're not living for tomorrow or next year.""
The single, artwork and accompanying music video – with a montage of a Loverboy program from the band's 1983 Keep It Up tour – prominently features the late bassist Scott Smith. ""It was one of the first tunes we ever recorded,"" he said. ""He's playing his ass off on it. I thought it was lost and gone forever. And, I think it would be a really good addition to our set list!""
In 2016 a commercial and digital short for National Car Rental started airing that features the band and major fan Patrick Warburton, best known for his role as David Puddy in Seinfeld. After Warburton touts that four out of five National rentals result in a free upgrade, the group piles into the rental car with Warburton and drives home the commercial's message with the title of one of their many hits, ""Lovin' Every Minute of It"". There is also a digital short, specifically made available on National Car Rental's YouTube channel, with Warburton having the group autograph their Get Lucky album, and pledging his devotion.
In 2017 the band released a new single, ""Stop the Rain"" and appeared at the Rockingham Festival 2017, held at Nottingham Trent University, UK, between October 20–22, 2017. The band headlined on Sunday, October 22, 2017.

2022–present
In 2022 the band released a new single, ""Release"" and toured with REO Speedwagon and Styx.

It featured William Garwood, a respected actor at the time. The film was produced by the Thanhouser Company and released in black and white.

Synopsis
May Deering is the daughter of Professor Deering, a celebrated astronomer who is more interested in stargazing than he is in his daughter's love life. Her sweetheart, Jack Webster disguises himself as an elderly astronomer so that he can sneak into the residence to see the girl of his dreams. Jack introduces himself to the professor as ""Graf Heinrich von Twiller, A.M.B.C., Professor of Astronomy, University of Bauergarten.""  Prof. Deering, excited to meet a fellow colleague, invites the young man to look through his telescope.
Jack pretends to see something very unusual and pulls Prof. Deering over to the instrument. As the professor searches in vain to see the ""unique discovery"", Jack gets to kiss May. When the professor leaves Jack and May for a moment, Jack paints the design of a comet on the telescope's lens, causing the old professor to jump for joy when he returns and spies it. While the old scientist makes a fool of himself by inviting some learned colleagues over to look at ""the comet"", Jack divests himself of his disguise, and has already erased the drawing of the comet from the lens.
Prof. Deering faints when he finds that the comet has disappeared. Jack makes a deal with the professor, telling him that he will make the comet reappear and save him from embarrassment at the hands of his fellow scientists if the professor will consent to May's marrying him. The Professor agrees, and the two sweethearts are united in marriage.

Reviews
A 1911 review in The Billboard described the film as having “very good acting” but little in the way of surprises or suspense.

The film premiered January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and has also been shown at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival, as well as other film festivals.

Synopsis
In the 1980s, video games were synonymous with arcades, and games were bringing in enough quarters to fill the Rose Bowl.  This led Iowa entrepreneur Walter Day (with the support of various game manufacturers) to declare himself the sole authority on high scores.  In 1982, Day launched his Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard.  Teenage superstars came from all over North America to join Walter in a Life magazine feature spread, which recognized them as video game world champions.  This led to the nationally televised 1982 Video Game World Championships, a touring National Video Game Team, and the promise of fame, fortune and groupies.
The film revisits Day and the Life players, now middle-aged men, as they reminisce on the arcade scene, its demise, and the dreams that crashed with it.

Reception
Stephen Garrett of Time Out New York compared the film to the documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, which covers similar ground and also premiered at the same time, opining that Chasing Ghosts explores the material far better.
Pixar's Andrew Stanton, director of the films WALL-E and Finding Nemo, saw the premiere of the film at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and enjoyed it so much that he arranged for a private screening of the film at Pixar's Emeryville, California campus.

24399617,/m/07s63_7,Bruce Lee: The Lost Interview,,30.0,['english'],1994-11-02,['Canada'],['Canada'],,,"Bruce Lee: The Lost Interview is the name given to the 9 December 1971 edition of The Pierre Berton Show, which featured martial artist/actor Bruce Lee in his only English speaking television interview. Its title is derived from its status; it was presumed lost for several years until its rediscovery and airing on 2 November 1994. Over the course of the interview, which was filmed in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee and Pierre Berton discuss Lee's career, various aspects of martial arts philosophy and the inherent problems faced by an Asian in pursuing stardom in Hollywood. A review of the interview by Bill Stockey said that Bruce Lee's ""human side is exposed and he is portrayed as more approachable"".

Interview summary
In the first few minutes of the interview, Bruce Lee asserts that he speaks Cantonese and reveals that he does not actually speak Mandarin despite his successes starring in many Mandarin movies. He discloses the fact that he just mouths the words while they shoot the Mandarin film, but someone else's voice is played over his for when the final movie is released.
Berton asks about Bruce Lee's career in terms of his shift from martial arts to his role as an actor in various movies, to which Lee says that he never expected that his love of martial art would lead to him becoming an actor in movies. Bruce Lee goes further into his martial arts career and talks about how it shaped him into the person he has become (as an actor, martial artist, and human being). Lee also asserts that he has never had a stunt double in any movie that he has acted in.
Berton then questions him about his acting career and the martial arts school that he set in up in Hollywood. Bruce Lee explains that he set up the school to teach martial arts like judo, karate, and Chinese boxing to people like James Garner, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, and James Coburn in order to help them to learn how to express their feelings (e.g. anger, determination, pride or happiness) through movements of the body. Lee says that the school was not set up to train people for acting roles, but rather to teach the art of expressing the human body in combated form (he also demonstrates the different types of combat movements as he speaks).
Lee also talks about his future career in Hollywood and discusses which series he is going to be in. He talks about the differences in Western and Eastern media that he noticed, such as the likelihood of violence occurring more often in Western films in day-to-day activities. When talking about Western media, he says that there is a lack of the true oriental person being portrayed in the media i.e. there are constant depictions of stereotypes (e.g. pigtails, slim eyes) in Western media.
Berton asks about the problems he has faced as an Asian in Western society in terms of fears of not being accepted by Western audiences, and Lee says it is not a strange occurrence to be unaccepted because it is even seen as a business risk for most film producers. This is because of the idea that the general audience will perceive the actor as foreign. He explains that it is the same in Asia when a foreigner is seen in the media. He also says that when he does Chinese films, he tries not to act as Western as he normally would because he wouldn't want to be perceived as different from other Chinese people. However, when he goes back to the United States, it is the other way around because he is perceived as an exotic person so the film producers try to get him to do things for the sake of being exotic or foreign.
Berton also asks if Lee considers himself American or Chinese to which he explains that he would like to think of himself as a human being. He says:

""You know what I think of myself? As a human being, because I mean I don't want to be like as Confucius say, but under the sky, under the heavens, there is but one family. It just so happens that people are different.""

32104837,/m/0g4zl4c,It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,,99.0,['english'],1984-12-15,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"""It Came Upon the Midnight Clear"", sometimes rendered as ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"", is an 1849 poem and Christmas carol written by Edmund Sears, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Wayland, Massachusetts. In 1850, Sears' lyrics were set to ""Carol"", a tune written for the poem the same year at his request, by Richard Storrs Willis. This pairing remains the most popular in the United States, while in Commonwealth countries, the lyrics are set to ""Noel"", a later adaptation by Arthur Sullivan from an English melody.

History
Edmund Sears composed the five-stanza poem in common metre doubled during 1849. It first appeared on December 29, 1849, in The Christian Register in Boston, Massachusetts.
Sears served the Unitarian congregation in Wayland, Massachusetts, before moving on to a larger congregation at First Church of Christ, Unitarian, in Lancaster, also known as The Bulfinch Church, for its design by Charles Bulfinch. After seven years, he suffered a breakdown and returned to Wayland. He wrote It Came Upon the Midnight Clear while serving as a part-time preacher in Wayland. Writing during a period of personal melancholy, and with news of revolution in Europe and the United States' war with Mexico fresh in his mind, Sears portrayed the world as dark, full of ""sin and strife"", and not hearing the Christmas message.

Sears is said to have written these words at the request of his friend, William Parsons Lunt, pastor of United First Parish Church, Quincy, Massachusetts, for Lunt's Sunday school. One account says the carol was first performed by parishioners gathered in Sears' home on Christmas Eve, but to what tune the carol was sung is unknown as Willis' familiar melody was not written until the following year.
According to Ken Sawyer, Sears' song is remarkable for its focus not on Bethlehem, but on his own time, and on the contemporary issue of war and peace. Written in 1849, it has long been assumed to be Sears' response to the just ended Mexican–American War. The song has been included in many of the Christmas albums recorded by numerous singers in the modern era.

Melody
In 1850, Richard Storrs Willis, a composer who trained under Felix Mendelssohn, wrote the melody called ""Carol"". This melody is most often set in the key of B-flat major in a 6/8 time signature. ""Carol"" is still the most widely known tune to the song in the United States.

In Commonwealth countries, the tune called ""Noel"", which was adapted from an English melody in 1874 by Arthur Sullivan, is the usual accompaniment. This tune also appears as an alternative in The Hymnal 1982, the hymnal of the United States Episcopal Church.

Lyrics
The full song comprises five stanzas. Some versions, including the United Methodist Hymnal and Lutheran Book of Worship, omit verse three, while others (including The Hymnal 1982) omit verse four. Several variations also exist to Sears' original lyrics.

20334086,/m/04zyc0t,Vipers,,89.0,[],2008-09-21,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Vipers are snakes in the family Viperidae, found in most parts of the world, except for Antarctica, Australia, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand, Ireland, and various other isolated islands. They are venomous and have long (relative to non-vipers), hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of their venom. Three subfamilies are currently recognized. They are also known as viperids. The name ""viper"" is derived from the Latin word vipera, -ae, also meaning viper, possibly from vivus (""living"") and parere (""to beget""), referring to the trait viviparity (giving live birth) common in vipers like most of the species of Boidae.

Description
All viperids have a pair of relatively long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs that are used to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is at the front of the mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. This rotating mechanism allows for very long fangs to be contained in a relatively small mouth. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Pre-digestion occurs as the venom contains proteases, which degrade tissues. Secondarily, it is used for self defense, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve its precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, time is needed to replenish it, leaving the snake vulnerable. In addition to being able to deliver dry bites, vipers can inject larger quantities of venom into larger prey targets, and smaller amounts into small prey. This causes the ideal amount of predigestion for the lowest amount of venom.
Almost all vipers have keeled scales, a stocky build with a short tail, and a triangle-shaped head distinct from the neck, owing to the location of the venom glands. The great majority have vertically elliptical, or slit-shaped, pupils that can open wide to cover most of the eye or close almost completely, which helps them to see in a wide range of light levels. Typically, vipers are nocturnal and ambush their prey.

Compared to many other snakes, vipers often appear rather sluggish. Most are ovoviviparous: the eggs are retained inside the mother's body, and the young emerge living. However, a few lay eggs in nests. Typically, the number of young in a clutch remains constant, but as the weight of the mother increases, larger eggs are produced, yielding larger young.

Geographic range
Viperid snakes are found in the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, and South Asia. In the Americas, they are native from south of 48°N. In the Old World, viperids are located everywhere except Siberia, Ireland, and north of the Arctic Circle in Norway and Sweden. Wild viperids are not found in Australia. The common adder, a viperid, is the only venomous snake found in Great Britain.

Venom
Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated by coagulopathy, and disruption of the blood-clotting system. Also being vasculotoxic in nature, viperine venom causes vascular endothelial damage and hemolysis. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. This is in contrast to elapid venoms, which generally contain neurotoxins that disable muscle contraction and cause paralysis. Death from elapid bites usually results from asphyxiation because the diaphragm can no longer contract, but this rule does not always apply; some elapid bites include proteolytic symptoms typical of viperid bites, while some viperid bites produce neurotoxic symptoms.
Proteolytic venom is also dual-purpose: first, it is used for defense and to immobilize prey, as with neurotoxic venoms; second, many of the venom's enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. This is an important adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.
Due to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated. A victim's fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom or the antivenom.

Behavior
These snakes can decide how much venom to inject depending on the circumstances. The most important determinant of venom expenditure is generally the size of the snake; larger specimens can deliver much more venom. The species is also important, since some are likely to inject more venom than others, may have more venom available, strike more accurately, or deliver a number of bites in a short time. In predatory bites, factors that influence the amount of venom injected include the size of the prey, the species of prey, and whether the prey item is held or released. The need to label prey for chemosensory relocation after a bite and release may also play a role. In defensive bites, the amount of venom injected may be determined by the size or species of the predator (or antagonist), as well as the assessed level of threat, although larger assailants and higher threat levels may not necessarily lead to larger amounts of venom being injected.

Prey tracking
Hemotoxic venom takes more time than neurotoxic venom to immobilize prey, so viperid snakes need to track down prey animals after they have been bitten, in a process known as ""prey relocalization"". Vipers are able to do this via certain proteins contained in their venom. This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. This adaptation, then, requires the snake to track down the bitten animal to eat it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. Western diamondback rattlesnakes respond more actively to mouse carcasses that have been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins, which are responsible for allowing the snakes to track down their prey.

Subfamilies
Type genus = Vipera Laurenti, 1768

Sensory organs
Heat-sensing pits
Pit vipers have specialized sensory organs near the nostrils called heat-sensing pits. The location of this organ is unique to pit vipers. These pits have the ability to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded animals, helping them better understand their environment. Internally the organ forms a small pit lined with membranes, external and internal, attached to the trigeminal nerve. Infrared light signals the internal membranes, which in turn signal the trigeminal nerve and send the infrared signals to the brain, where they are overlaid onto the visual image created by the eyes.

Taxonomy
Whether family Viperidae is attributed to Oppel (1811), as opposed to Laurenti (1768) or Gray (1825), is subject to some interpretation. The consensus among leading experts, though, is that Laurenti used viperae as the plural of vipera (Latin for ""viper"", ""adder"", or ""snake"") and did not intend for it to indicate a family group taxon. Rather, it is attributed to Oppel, based on his Viperini as a distinct family group name, despite the fact that Gray was the first to use the form Viperinae.

31137877,/m/0gh7n22,Boadicea,,,[],,[],[],,,"Boudica or Boudicca (, from Brythonic *boudi 'victory, win' + *-kā 'having' suffix, i.e. 'Victorious Woman', known in Latin chronicles as Boadicea or Boudicea, and in Welsh as Buddug, pronounced [ˈbɨðɨɡ]) was a queen of the ancient British Iceni tribe, who led a failed uprising against the conquering forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61. She is considered a British national heroine and a symbol of the struggle for justice and independence.
Boudica's husband Prasutagus, with whom she had two daughters, ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome. He left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and to the Roman emperor in his will. When he died, his will was ignored, and the kingdom was annexed and his property taken. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped. The historian Cassius Dio wrote that previous imperial donations to influential Britons were confiscated and the Roman financier and philosopher Seneca called in the loans he had forced on the reluctant Britons.
In 60/61, Boudica led the Iceni and other British tribes in revolt. They destroyed Camulodunum (modern Colchester), earlier the capital of the Trinovantes, but at that time a colonia for discharged Roman soldiers. Upon hearing of the revolt, the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus hurried from the island of Mona (modern Anglesey) to Londinium, the 20-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target. Unable to defend the settlement, he evacuated and abandoned it. Boudica's army defeated a detachment of the Legio IX Hispana, and burnt both Londinium and Verulamium. In all, an estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and Britons were killed by Boudica's followers. Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces, possibly in the West Midlands, and despite being heavily outnumbered, he decisively defeated the Britons. Boudica died, by suicide or illness, shortly afterwards. The crisis of 60/61 caused Nero to consider withdrawing all his imperial forces from Britain, but Suetonius's victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province.
Interest in these events was revived in the English Renaissance and led to Boudica's fame in the Victorian era and as a cultural symbol in Britain.

Historical sources
The Boudican revolt against the Roman Empire is referred to in four works from classical antiquity written by three Roman historians: the Agricola (c. 98) and Annals (c. 110s) by Tacitus; a mention of the uprising by Suetonius in his Lives of the Caesars (121); and the longest account, a detailed description of the revolt contained within Cassius Dio's history of the Empire (c. 202 – c. 235).
Tacitus wrote some years after the rebellion, but his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola was an eyewitness to the events, having served in Britain as a tribune under Suetonius Paulinus during this period.
Cassius Dio began his history of Rome and its empire about 140 years after Boudica's death. Much is lost and his account of Boudica survives only in the epitome of an 11th-century Byzantine monk, John Xiphilinus. He provides greater and more lurid detail than Tacitus, but in general his details are often fictitious.
Both Tacitus and Dio give an account of battle-speeches given by Boudica, though it is thought that her words were never recorded during her life. Although imaginary, these speeches, designed to provide a comparison for readers of the antagonists' demands and approaches to war, and to portray the Romans as morally superior to their enemy, helped create an image of patriotism that turned Boudica into a legendary figure.

Background
Boudica was the consort of Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, a tribe who inhabited what is now the English county of Norfolk and parts of the neighbouring counties of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Lincolnshire. The Iceni produced some of the earliest known British coins. They had revolted against the Romans in 47 when the Roman governor Publius Ostorius Scapula planned to disarm all the peoples of Britain under Roman control. The Romans allowed the kingdom to retain its independence once the uprising was suppressed.

Events leading to the revolt
On his death in AD 60/61, Prasutagus made his two daughters as well as the Roman Emperor Nero his heirs. The Romans ignored the will, and the kingdom was absorbed into the province of Britannia. Catus Decianus, procurator of Britain, was sent to secure the Iceni kingdom for Rome.

The Romans' next actions were described by Tacitus, who detailed pillaging of the countryside, the ransacking of the king's household, and the brutal treatment of Boudica and her daughters. According to Tacitus, Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped. These abuses are not mentioned in Dio's account, who instead cites three different causes for the rebellion: the recalling of loans that were given to the Britons by Seneca; Decianus Catus's confiscation of money formerly loaned to the Britons by the Emperor Claudius; and Boudica's own entreaties. The loans were thought by the Iceni to have been repaid by gift exchange.
Dio gives Boudica a speech to her people and their allies reminding them that life was much better before the Roman occupation, stressing that wealth cannot be enjoyed under slavery and placing the blame upon herself for not expelling the Romans as they had done when Julius Caesar invaded. The willingness of those seen as barbarians to sacrifice a higher quality of living under the Romans in exchange for their freedom and personal liberty was an important part of what Dio considered to be motivation for the rebellions.

Uprising
Attacks on Camulodunum, Londinium and Verulamium
The first target of the rebels was Camulodunum (modern Colchester), a Roman colonia for retired soldiers. A Roman temple had been erected there to Claudius, at great expense to the local population. Combined with brutal treatment of the Britons by the veterans, this had caused resentment towards the Romans.
The Iceni and the Trinovantes comprised an army of 120,000 men. Dio claimed that Boudica called upon the British goddess of victory Andraste to aid her army. Once the revolt had begun, the only Roman troops available to provide assistance, aside from the few within the colony, were 200 auxiliaries located in London, who were not equipped to fight Boudica's army. Camulodunum was captured by the rebels; those inhabitants who survived the initial attack took refuge in the Temple of Claudius for two days before they were killed. Quintus Petillius Cerialis, then commanding the Legio IX Hispana, attempted to relieve Camulodunum, but suffered an overwhelming defeat. The infantry with him were all killed and only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped. After this disaster, Catus Decianus, whose behaviour had provoked the rebellion, fled abroad to Gaul.
Suetonius was leading a campaign against the island of Mona, off the coast of North Wales. On hearing the news of the Iceni uprising, he left a garrison on Mona and returned to deal with Boudica. He moved quickly with a force of men through hostile territory to Londinium, which he reached before the arrival of Boudica's army but, outnumbered, he decided to abandon the town to the rebels, who burned it down after torturing and killing everyone who had remained. The rebels also sacked the municipium of Verulamium (modern St Albans), north-west of London, though the extent of its destruction is unclear.
Dio and Tacitus both reported that around 80,000 people were said to have been killed by the rebels. According to Tacitus, the Britons had no interest in taking the Roman population as prisoners, only in slaughter by ""gibbet, fire, or cross"". Dio adds that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, ""to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour"" in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.

Suetonius regrouped his forces. He amassed an army of almost 10,000 men at an unidentified location, and took a stand in a defile with a wood behind. The Romans used the terrain to their advantage, launching javelins at the Britons before advancing in a wedge-shaped formation and deploying cavalry.
The Roman army was heavily outnumbered — according to Dio the rebels numbered 230,000 — but Boudica's army was crushed, and according to Tacitus, neither the women nor the animals were spared. Tacitus states that Boudica poisoned herself; Dio says she fell sick and died, after which she was given a lavish burial. It has been argued that these accounts are not mutually exclusive.

Name
Boudica may have been an honorific title, in which case the name by which she was known during most of her life is unknown. The English linguist and translator Kenneth Jackson concluded that the name Boudica—based on later developments in Welsh (Buddug) and Irish (Buaidheach)—derives from the Proto-Celtic feminine adjective *boudīkā 'victorious', which in turn is derived from the Celtic word *boudā 'victory', and that the correct spelling of the name in Common Brittonic (the British Celtic language) is Boudica, pronounced [boʊˈdiːkaː]. Variations on the historically correct Boudica include Boudicca, Bonduca, Boadicea, and Buduica. The Gaulish version of her name is attested in inscriptions as Boudiga in Bordeaux, Boudica in Lusitania, and Bodicca in Algeria.
Boudica's name was spelt incorrectly by Dio, who used Buduica. Her name was also misspelled by Tacitus, who added a second 'c.' After the misspelling was copied by a medieval scribe, further variations began to appear. Along with the second 'c' becoming an 'e,' an 'a' appeared in place of the 'u', which produced the medieval (and most common) version of the name, Boadicea. The true spelling was totally obscured when Boadicea first appeared in around the 17th century. William Cowper used this spelling in his poem Boadicea, an Ode (1782), a work whose impact resulted in Boudica's reinvention as a British imperialistic champion.

Early literature
One of the earliest possible mentions of Boudica (excluding Tacitus' and Dio's accounts) was the 6th century work De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae by the British monk Gildas. In it, he demonstrates his knowledge of a female leader whom he describes as a ""treacherous lioness"" who ""butchered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavours of Roman rule.""
Both Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People (731) and the 9th century work Historia Brittonum by the Welsh monk Nennius include references to the uprising of 60/61—but do not mention Boudica.
No contemporary description of Boudica exists. Dio, writing more than a century after her death, provided a detailed description of the Iceni queen (translated in 1925): ""In stature she was very tall, in appearance most terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh; a great mass of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace; and she wore a tunic of divers colours over which a thick mantle was fastened with a brooch. This was her invariable attire.""

Revival and the modern legend
16th and 17th century literature
During the Renaissance the works of Tacitus and Cassius Dio became available in England, after which her status changed as it was interpreted by historians, poets and dramatists. Boudica appeared as 'Voadicia' in a history, Anglica Historia, by the Italian scholar Polydore Vergil, and in the Scottish historian Hector Boece's The History and Chronicles of Scotland (1526) she is 'Voada'—the first appearance of Boudica in a British publication.
Boudica was called 'Voadicia' in the English historian Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, published between 1577 and 1587. A narrative by the Florentine scholar Petruccio Ubaldini in The Lives of the Noble Ladies of the Kingdom of England and Scotland (1591) includes two female characters, 'Voadicia' and 'Bunduica', both based on Boudica. From the 1570s to the 1590s, when Elizabeth I's England was at war with Spain, Boudica proved to be a valuable asset for the English.
The English poet Edmund Spenser used the story of Boudica in his poem The Ruines of Time, involving a story about a British heroine he called 'Bunduca'. A variation of this name was used in the Jacobean play Bonduca (1612), a tragicomedy that most scholars agree was written by John Fletcher, in which one of the characters was Boudica. A version of that play called Bonduca, or the British Heroine was set to music by the English composer Henry Purcell in 1695. One of the choruses, ""Britons, Strike Home!"", became a popular patriotic song in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Depiction during the 18th and 19th centuries
During the late 18th century, Boudica was used to develop ideas of English nationhood. Illustrations of Boudica during this period—such as in Edward Barnard's New, Complete and Authentic History of England (1790) and the drawing by Thomas Stothard of the queen as a classical heroine—lacked historical accuracy. The illustration of Boudica by Robert Havell in Charles Hamilton Smith's The Costume of the Original Inhabitants of the British Islands from the Earliest Periods to the Sixth Century (1815) was an early attempt to depict her in an historically accurate way.
Cowper's 1782 poem Boadicea: An Ode was the most notable literary work to champion the resistance of the Britons, and helped to project British ideas of imperial expansion. It caused Boudica to become a British cultural icon and be perceived as a national heroine. Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Boädicéa (written in 1859, and published in 1864) drew on Cowper's poem. Depicting the Iceni queen as a violent and bloodthirsty warrior, the poem also forecasted the rise of British imperialism. Tennyson's image of Boudica was taken from the engraving produced in 1812 by Stothard. Another work, the poem ""Boadicea"" (1859) by Francis Barker, contained strongly patriotic and Christian themes.
A range of Victorian children's books mentioned Boudica; Beric the Briton (1893), a novel by G. A. Henty, with illustrations by William Parkinson, had a text based on the accounts of Tacitus and Dio.
Boadicea and Her Daughters, a statue of the queen in her war chariot, complete with anachronistic scythes on the wheel axles, was executed by the sculptor Thomas Thornycroft. He was encouraged by Prince Albert, who lent his horses for use as models. The statue, Thornycroft's most ambitious work, was produced  between 1856 and 1871, cast in 1896, and positioned on the Victoria Embankment next to Westminster Bridge in 1902.

20th century – present
Boudica was once thought to have been buried at a place which lies now between platforms 9 and 10 in King's Cross station in London. There is no evidence for this and it is probably a post-World War II invention. At Colchester Town Hall, a life-sized statue of Boudica stands on the south facade, sculpted by L J Watts in 1902; another depiction of her is in a stained glass window by Clayton and Bell in the council chamber.
Boudica was adopted by the suffragettes as one of the symbols of the campaign for women's suffrage. In 1908, a ""Boadicea Banner"" was carried in several National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies marches. She appears as a character in A Pageant of Great Women written by Cicely Hamilton, which opened at the Scala Theatre, London, in November 1909 before a national tour, and she was described in a 1909 pamphlet as ""the eternal feminine... the guardian of the hearth, the avenger of its wrongs upon the defacer and the despoiler"".
A ""vocal minority"" has claimed Boudica as a Celtic Welsh heroine. A statue of Boudica in the Marble Hall at Cardiff City Hall was among those unveiled by David Lloyd George in 1916, though the choice had gained little support in a public vote. It shows her with her daughters and without warrior trappings.
Permanent exhibitions describing the Boudican Revolt are at the Museum of London, Colchester Castle Museum and the Verulamium Museum. A 36-mile (58 km) long distance footpath called Boudica's Way passes through countryside between Norwich and Diss in Norfolk.

Susan feels neglected and has been trying to make Philip jealous by demonstrating a romantic interest in Henry, who begins taking her seriously. Now that they are alone on the island, Philip constructs a large hut for his wife and himself and a little hut for Henry, but before long Henry is suggesting they share not only food and water but Susan as well.
Opposed to this, Susan nevertheless is offended by Philip's indifferent reaction to Henry's indecent proposal. The quarrel escalates until Philip declares that, as captain of their ship, he feels entitled not only to perform marriages but to grant divorces. He awaits Susan's decision on whether the men should change huts or share and share alike.
This potential ménage à trois where the two men are competing for the lady's attention is interrupted by a fourth visitor. The stranger is dressed in native garb and takes Susan captive, but is soon revealed to be Mario, the chef from their yacht, indulging a whim.

25413122,/m/04j1nd9,Drums in the Deep South,,87.0,['english'],1951-01-01,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Best friends Clay Clayburn and Will Denning graduate from West Point and visit their friend and fellow graduate Braxton Summers at his Georgia plantation in 1861. Clay had once loved Braxton's wife Kathy and still does.  When war is declared they soon find themselves fighting on opposite sides of the Civil War.
By 1864, Clay, now a field artillery major in the Confederate States Army, is renowned for accepting and surviving suicide missions. He is given another task: in order to delay General Sherman's March to the Sea, he is ordered to lead a party of men and their disassembled cannon inside caves that lead to the top of Devil's Mountain, where a battery of guns can destroy a railroad (running through nearby Snake Gap) and the Union troop and supply trains that travel it, buying time for the Confederacy. Devil's Mountain is coincidentally near Braxton's (who is now fighting elsewhere for the Confederacy) and Kathy's old plantation where Kathy remains with her uncle Albert. Kathy agrees to monitor the activities of the Northern invaders and to signal Clay's men from her window through a mirror by day and a lantern by night. At one point, having been caught signaling to Clay by one of the Union soldiers, Albert mortally wounds him before being shot dead himself. Through her activities, Clay's men are notified of the arrival of two supply trains and destroy both of them.
Will, now a major himself, arrives on the field, but the Union artillery cannot achieve the elevation or range with their cannon to clear the Confederate guns at the top of the mountain. Inside the mountain, the Union infantry cannot find the path to the top and are delayed by Confederate snipers. As the railroad line has been blocked by two destroyed trains, Union headquarters send a Dahlgren gun manned by sailors and mounted on a flat car to wipe out the Confederates. Kathy supplies Clay with wire from her piano to reinforce the barrel of one of Clay's guns that, with a double charge and the maximum elevation, is able to destroy the naval gun and further block the railroad line.
Will has Union Army engineers mine the inside of the mountain with explosives that will blow up the mountain. However, Clay calculates that the explosion will send the cliff down over the railway line further blocking the Union's supplies. Kathy begs Will that she be allowed to act as a mediator to convince Clay and his men to surrender, and Will agrees. As she traverses the caverns on the way to the top, Kathy is mistaken for a Union soldier and shot by one of Clay's soldiers. Bringing her to Clay, she repeats the Union offer of surrender as Clay nurses her wound. Ordering his men to escape Devil's Mountain, Clay picks up Kathy and begins making his way down. However, the powder is lit and Devil's Mountain explodes, seemingly killing Clay and Kathy.",

The hypersexual Vixen nevertheless seduces anyone within reach including a Mountie, a couple her husband brings home as clients – the husband first, his wife later, and eventually her own brother, Judd. The only person she will not have sex with is Judd's friend Niles, an African American Vietnam War deserter, whom Vixen verbally abuses with racist insults.
A wealthy Irish tourist (who is really a Marxist Irish Republican Army sympathizer) entices the couple to fly him and – against Vixen's protestations – Niles to the United States. In the air, he attempts to hijack the small Cessna 177 Cardinal to Cuba, taking Vixen and her pilot husband as hostages. Niles is reluctant to take sides, but, after some altercations, Tom and Niles overwhelm the perpetrator. In return for his support, Tom helps Niles escape the US customs; as they are parting, Niles and Vixen conciliate.
At the end of the film, her husband takes on another couple and Vixen smiles in a sinister and disturbing way, apparently planning to seduce them. The final slide reads ""The End?"".",

His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt in Lavenham, England, who named him her sole heir.
Mario rushes to England and learns that his inheritance consists of not much; only thirteen antique chairs that have a certain value. He sells them to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his Aunt Laura's last message that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs, but is unsuccessful. With the help of lovely American antiques dealer Pat, who works in the antiques shop in front of Aunt Laura's house, where he sold the chairs, he launches a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes the duo from London to Paris, then to Rome. Along the way they meet a bunch of equally bizarre characters, including Albert, the driver of a furniture-moving van; a prostitute named Judy; Maurice, the leader of a traveling theater company that stages a poor version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; and Italian entrepreneur Carlo Di Seta and his vivacious daughter Stefanella.
The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the jewels finds its way into a truck and is collected by nuns who auction it off for charity. With nothing left to do as a result of the failure of his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship. Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him.
The film ends with Mario returning to New York City and his barber shop. His friends at the other (and more lavish) shop join him, as do two construction workers and his last customer, Randomhouse. It is there that Mario makes a strange discovery: shortly before his departure for Europe, he invented a way to make hair regrow miraculously. He laughs ecstatically, even maniacally, over his discovery.",

The church is full of veterans who knew and loved him. Her mother Ethel Ann is sitting out on the church porch, smoking and nursing a hangover.
Ethel is indifferent to Chuck's death, which only her friend Jack Etty seems to understand. Marie is furious with her mother and with her implication that she slept with many of the veterans when they were all young, but then Ethel relents and says that she was always faithful. It emerges that there is a lot Marie does not know about her mother's past and the true story of her love life.
A young Ethel was in love with young farmer Teddy Gordon, who builds a house with his best friends Jack and Chuck. Her parents think she is dating ""good old reliable"" Chuck (all three are in love with her), but within days of the Pearl Harbor attack, she has accepted Teddy's gold ring and unofficially married him – with Jack and Chuck as witnesses. The three young men fly out the next day. Teddy and Jack are stationed at RAF Langford Lodge near Belfast, where Jack plans to eventually propose to Eleanor, an Irish tart.
In 1991 in Belfast Jimmy Riley, Eleanor's young adult grandson, encounters local elder Michael Quinlan, who is digging for wreckage of a crashed B-17 aircraft on nearby Black Mountain. Jimmy finds a ring at the site and determines to return it to the woman from the ""Ethel & Teddy"" inscription. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs identify an Ethel to whom crash victim Teddy Gordon left his belongings.
Jimmy flees The Troubles for Michigan to give Ethel the ring. She reveals a wall covered in souvenirs of Teddy, which Jack and Chuck boarded up for her shortly after his death in June 1944. Marie is shocked and furious to learn that her mother still mourns for him, finally understanding why Ethel shut out Marie and Chuck. Jack later tells her the full story, including his own three failed marriages, Ethel's refusal to leave the house Teddy built for her, and her taking ten years to marry Chuck. Jack's son, Pete, realizes Jack always loved Ethel.
Ethel travels to Belfast with Jimmy. As she holds the hand of a dying British soldier after an IRA car-bomb attack, Quinlan tells Ethel that he, as a teenager, was on Black Mountain when Teddy died. Teddy had him promise to give Ethel the ring, and tell her she must be free to make her own choice in love. Quinlan tearfully says he should have reached out to her back then, and that he had spent 50 years looking for the ring that was lost in the final blast that killed Teddy, now regretfully thinking she needed it as much as she needed his dying words.
Joining Ethel in Belfast, Jack confesses that he has always loved her. She is finally able to cry and properly grieve for Teddy. She and Jack embrace.",
