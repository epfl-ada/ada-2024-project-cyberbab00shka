975900,/m/03vyhn,Ghosts of Mars,14010832.0,98.0,['english'],2001-08-24,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Set in the year 2176, Mars has been 85% terraformed, giving the planet an Earth-like atmosphere. Martian society has become matriarchal, centering on the city of Chryse, with smaller outposts connected by an expansive network of trains. In the wake of a series of mysterious 'incidents', Police Officer Melanie Ballard is called before a tribunal to give testimony following a disastrous mission to the remote mining outpost Shining Canyon to retrieve convicted felon James 'Desolation' Williams, of which she is apparently the sole survivor.
Through a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks as new perspectives are incorporated into the narrative), Ballard recounts details of the mission. Accompanied by commanding officer Helena Braddock, cocky sergeant Jericho Butler and rookie officers Bashira Kincaid and Michael Descanso, Ballard arrives at Shining Canyon to find the town seemingly deserted. Investigating the local jail, Braddock discovers a trio of individuals who appear to have sealed themselves into one of the cells; among them science officer Dr Arlene Whitlock.
Ballard and Butler find a number of disoriented miners and the convict Williams, who has escaped. The group is attacked by several of the miners, causing Ballard and Williams to band together and incapacitate them. Ballard is forced to shoot and kill one of them, causing the affliction to be passed on to one of the three survivors. Butler, venturing out to the edge of town in pursuit of one of the feral miners, discovers a row of severed heads mounted on spikes, including the head of Commander Braddock and a large assembly in the canyon below committing horrific acts of self-mutilation and ritualistic execution.
Friends of Williams arrive and force Ballard and Butler to release him. While they originally plan on leaving the officers and remaining miners to die, Ballard convinces them to work together to survive. Their initial effort to escape is halted when the army of feral miners converge on their position, killing, injuring and infecting several of them. Confronted by Ballard, Whitlock eventually explains that she fled from her post after discovering an ancient underground vault created by an extinct Martian civilization. When the door to the vault was opened, it released hostile spirits or ""ghosts"", which took possession of the workers, causing their violent behavior. Killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another host. Ballard surmises that these Martian spirits believe humans to be an invading race. Ballard is briefly possessed until Butler feeds her a hallucinogenic drug, which forces the Martian spirit to leave her body.
The group is forced to flee as the possessed workers breach the jail, leaving only Ballard, Williams, Butler, Kincaid and Whitlock left alive. While they are able to make it to the train, Ballard realizes that they have a duty to exterminate the Martian threat and decide to return to Shining Canyon to overload the outpost's nuclear power plant, assuming that the ensuing atomic blast will vaporize the spirits. While they are able to initiate the meltdown, Whitlock is possessed, while Butler, Kincaid and the two train operators are killed. Boarding the train, the two watch as the army is engulfed in the explosion. Williams tends to Ballard's wounds. Unwilling to face the authorities, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and leaves. She moves to shoot him, but realizes her respect for him and lets him escape.
Resting after her trial, Ballard is woken by an alert that the city is under attack. Realizing their attempt to destroy the spirits failed, she readies herself to face the onslaught alone until she is greeted by Williams, who hands her a weapon. The two agree to fight their way out of the city together.",

The family admires their Christmas tree, as the film intercuts with scenes of JonBenét's autopsy. Before JonBenét is put to bed, John leads her in the Christian child's prayer ""Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep"". The following morning, Patsy finds a ransom note on the kitchen staircase. The note demands $118,000 in exchange for the return of JonBenét; it further claims that JonBenét will be executed if John and Patsy refuse to pay the ransom. Investigators arrive to the Ramsey residence and question John and Patsy in an effort to determine who wrote the ransom note. The residence is then thoroughly searched by the investigators, who discover JonBenét's corpse in the basement. The investigators call for an ambulance, as they remove duct tape from JonBenét's mouth and a cord that is tied around her wrists. As JonBenét's body is brought upstairs, John and Patsy become hysterical. A reverend leads the couple in prayer in an effort to calm them down.
Assigned to write a story about JonBenét's death, a reporter (Alice Barrett-Mitchell) travels to Boulder. Upon arrival to the city, she interviews the Ramsey's friends and neighbors, in addition to city officials. As she watches a televised interview with John and Patsy, the reporter begins to grow suspicious of the couple. She receives a call from a detective (Brad Greenquist) who claims that he wants her to know the truth about JonBenét's death. The detective, however, has second thoughts and ends the call. As investigators begin to consider John and Patsy as suspects, the reporter receives a second call from the detective. The detective claims that John and Patsy murdered JonBenét, however, he asks the reporter to not run the story over concerns that it will be traced back to him. As news coverage of the killing increases, the reporter receives a call from another detective (Albert Hall). This detective claims that John and Patsy are innocent, and that the Boulder Police Department are attempting to frame the couple. He alleges that JonBenét was actually killed by Bill McReynolds, Randy Simons, or Jeff Merrick, all of whom have connections with the Ramsey family. Confused over who was actually responsible for JonBenét's death, the reporter ultimately writes that the truth will only be discovered within time.","Alice Barrett-Mitchell as Reporter

9363483,/m/0285_cd,White Of The Eye,,110.0,['english'],1987-01-01,['United Kingdom'],['United Kingdom'],,,"A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona, bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then-boyfriend. Paul and Joan have a daughter, Danielle.
Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Mendoza—they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van—a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. At the police station, Mendoza's partner Phil has uncovered Paul's criminal record—they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information. Mendoza, working from photos of the crime scene, begins to identify some aspects of the killer's modus operandi.
Various flashbacks show Joan's previous relationship to Mike, traveling across the country from New York City in Mike's van, heading for Malibu. The couple met Paul, whom Mike befriended. At Mike's suggestion, the two men go on a deer hunting trip together. Paul shoots a deer and then brutally mutilates it, winding up with blood all over his face, revealing a frightening and incongruous aspect to his personality. Mike later catches Joan and Paul having sex. He puts a gun to the back of Paul's head but relents and leaves.
In the present-day, Joan, on her way to Stope's Creek, stops in a gas station asking for directions. As she walks around the building to the restroom, she hears a voice singing a familiar song—Mike. As they sit and catch up, Mike mentions that he's been in prison and that he received a serious head injury which seems to have given him the ability to see the past and the future. He emphatically asks Joan to promise not to tell Paul that she has seen him.
Joan suspects that Paul is having an affair with Ann Mason, a local married socialite, when she finds his truck parked behind her house. She stabs his tires flat, which winds up providing him with an alibi for the most-recent murder. Distraught, Joan runs to her home bathroom to vomit and notices some twine poking out from underneath the raised bathtub. She pries the inlaid soap-dish loose and looks underneath, and sees something strange: plastic bags with body parts inside. Joan confronts Paul, who explains he has been ""chosen"" to put women ""out of their misery,"" but he loves Joan.
Joan's continuing distrust of Paul agitates him into a fury. He locks her up in the attic, then dons an explosive vest and facepaint. Increasingly unhinged, Paul chases his daughter up through the attic, and minutes after accusing Joan of thinking that he'd ""hurt my own kid,"" attempts target practice of her fleeing form, missing Danielle, but killing their dog Shasta. Joan and the little girl escape in different directions and soon Joan has to elude Paul in the abandoned quarry. It turns out Mike has been staying there, armed with a machine gun, certain that he will meet Paul again. He rescues Joan and takes away Paul's gun, leading him to the edge of the quarry. Paul makes the sound he uses in the emptiness of living rooms and savors its echo from the quarry. While incessantly pontificating about his philosophies of life and death, Paul reveals a lighter with which he has lit the fuse of his explosive vest. Mike opens fire on him with a machine gun and Joan dives into the lake in the quarry. Paul and Mike both die instantly, in a hail of destruction. Joan is reunited later with her daughter. She talks with Detective Mendoza about what the ten years with Paul could have meant, whose destructive and nihilistic nature she never realized.",
261236,/m/01mrr1,A Woman in Flames,,106.0,['german'],1983-01-01,['Germany'],['Germany'],,,"Eva, an upper class housewife, becomes frustrated and leaves her arrogant husband. She is drawn to the idea of becoming a call girl. With the aid of a prostitute named Yvonne, Eva learns the basics and then they both set out looking for janes and johns together. She meets a charming man who she falls in love with and goes to his house late at night for a romantic tryst.  He turns out to be a gigolo.  Consequently, they move into his penthouse, which is large enough for both of them to offer their services separately.
Eva gradually moves into the world of sado-masochism. She finds being a dominatrix extremely satisfying, and begins to take pleasure in controlling others and causing them intense pain. She discovers this in a scene in which a man is hiding under a table. Eva can see that his hands are sticking out from under the table and are clearly visible. Coldly, and with intense inner satisfaction, Eva proceeds to crush the man's hands by slowly walking over them with her stiletto-heeled shoes.
Chris, the gigolo, becomes jealous of her and wants to know what's going on upstairs and how she is making so much money.  She tells him it is from hurting men, and that the more she hurts them, the more money she gets. This upsets him greatly. She also becomes jealous of a boyfriend/client he has been seeing/servicing for many years. The scenes in the upstairs room intensify.  One day he sneaks up and observes her in a scene dominating a man tied to a chair. He has a look on his face like ""see, this is what you truly are,"" and the look on her face says proudly ""yes, this is what I truly am."" He tries to whisk her away from all of it, buying her furs, talking about marriage.  She tells him that she's been dreaming about hitting him, and in the dream he likes it.
The setting is all there for a romantic ending, and yet, he panics, he takes all their money and invests it in a restaurant that she doesn't want to be part of.  She tries to walk out on him, and he gets angry, throws her against the wall, hits her, pours alcohol on her, and lights her on fire.
But the last scene shows her unscathed, happy with her friend the sex worker/madame, and they're getting thrown out of a bar that Chris owns.",

10408933,/m/02qc0j7,Alexander's Ragtime Band,3600000.0,106.0,['english'],1938-08-16,['United States of America'],['United States of America'],,,"Alexander's Ragtime Band is a 1938 American musical film released by 20th Century Fox that takes its name from the 1911 Irving Berlin song ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" to tell a story of a society boy who scandalizes his family by pursuing a career in ragtime instead of ""serious"" music. The film generally traces the history of jazz music from the popularization of Ragtime in the early years of the 20th century to the acceptance of swing as an art form in the late 1930s using music composed by Berlin. The story spans more than two decades from the 1911 release of its name-sake song to some point in time after the 1933 release of ""Heat Wave"", presumably 1938.
It stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley and Jean Hersholt. Several actual events in the history of jazz are fictionalized and adapted to the story including the tour of Europe by Original Dixieland Jass Band, the global spread of jazz by U.S. soldiers during World War I, and the 1938 Carnegie Hall performance by The Benny Goodman Orchestra.
The story was written by Berlin himself, with Kathryn Scola, Richard Sherman (1905–1962) and Lamar Trotti. In 1944, a federal judge ruled that most of the story by Berlin and collaborating writers had been plagiarized from a 1937 manuscript by author Marie Dieckhaus, but that decision was reversed on appeal.
Alexander's Ragtime Band was 20th Century Fox's highest-grossing film of the 1930s and was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning the award for Best Music, Scoring.

Cast
Songs
Alexander's Ragtime Band features several hit songs by Irving Berlin including ""Heat Wave"", ""Some Sunny Day"", ""Blue Skies"", ""Easter Parade"", ""A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody"" and ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"". Previously released songs were re-arranged and used in conjunction with new songs written by Berlin for the film.

Reception
The film had its New York premiere at the Roxy Theatre on August 5, 1938, with Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz heading the stage show.
Contemporary reviews from critics were positive. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote, ""With those twenty-six Berlin tunes at its disposal and with such assured song-pluggers as Alice Faye and Ethel Merman to put them over, the picture simply runs roughshod over minor critical objection and demands recognition as the best musical show of the year."" Variety wrote, ""Superlative in conception, execution and showmanship, it provides a rare theatrical and emotional experience."" Film Daily declared it ""solid entertainment that should play to big returns."" Harrison's Reports called it ""Excellent entertainment, capably directed and acted."" Russell Maloney of The New Yorker called the music ""reason enough to see the film,"" though he criticized the ""small, persistent, mosquitolike irritation of the plot"" and instances of anachronistic dialogue.
At the time of its release, Alexander's Ragtime Band was 20th Century Fox's highest-grossing film ever with $2.63 million in domestic rentals and $3.6 million in worldwide rentals.

Plagiarism lawsuit
In 1937, composer Irving Berlin had been approached by 20th Century Fox to write a story treatment for an upcoming film entitled ""Alexander's Ragtime Band."" Berlin agreed to write a story outline for the film which would feature many of Berlin's signature tunes. Released on August 5, 1938, Alexander's Ragtime Band was a smash hit with audiences and grossed in excess of five million dollars. However, soon after, a plagiarism lawsuit was filed by author Marie Cooper Dieckhaus against Berlin and 20th Century Fox. In 1944, a federal judge ruled in Dieckhaus' favor that Berlin and collaborating writers had plagiarized a 1937 manuscript by Dieckhaus and used many of its elements.
In 1937, Dieckhaus had submitted her manuscript to various Hollywood studio heads, literary agents, and other individuals for their perusal. The trial court ruled that much of her manuscript's plot was included in the film's screenplay. However, in 1946, this ruling was reversed on appeal because there was no evidence that Berlin and the others who worked on the film had ever seen Dieckhaus's manuscript.

Awards and honors
Alfred Newman won an Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring. The film was also nominated for:

Best Picture
Story – Irving Berlin
Song – Irving Berlin for ""Now It Can Be Told""
Art Direction – Bernard Herzbrun and Boris Leven
Film Editing – Barbara McLean

Radio adaptations
Alexander's Ragtime Band was presented as a one-hour radio adaptation on two occasions on Lux Radio Theatre. The first broadcast was on June 3, 1940. This adaptation starred Faye and Robert Preston. The second broadcast was on April 7, 1947, and starred Tyrone Power, Margaret Whiting, Al Jolson, Dick Haymes and Dinah Shore.
""A Birthday Tribute to Irving Berlin,"" an all-star celebration of Berlin's 50th birthday, broadcast on CBS on August 3, 1938, from New York, Hollywood, and Chicago, was coordinated with the premiere of the Fox film and concluded with a truncated dramatization of scenes from the film. Parts were read by Ethel Merman and Tyrone Power.

On a whim, Jim enlists with the Marines for four years, and goes drinking. After returning home and quarreling again with Sarah, he disappears with their young son Bobby, intending to sell him to the Ashmores.

Kevin sees a woman he wants, but loses interest in her after he gets her. He realizes this is not a healthy relationship pattern but does not know how to change it.
Rebecca, a single woman new to the ""small town"" of San Francisco, applies for a bartender job at the same bar Kevin works at. Although Kevin comes onto Rebecca immediately, she recognizes Kevin's playboy ways and rebuffs him; however, the two become good friends. Adam, Kevin's friend who drives a cab to support himself while he pursues his passion for painting, confides in Kevin about his girlfriend Nina and his suspicions she is having an affair. When Adam tries to initiate sex with Nina later at home, she tells him she is tired. Quickly realizing he may become suspicious, Nina changes her mind and decides to sleep with him; although, unbeknownst to Adam, she has just come back from sleeping with her lover.
Kevin and Nina meet in a Catholic church where he tells her that Adam suspects she is cheating on him. Nina is alarmed and asks Kevin if Adam knows who her lover is. It is revealed Kevin is the man with whom she is cheating on Adam with, stemming form her feelings of being neglected by Adam. The two express guilt over deceiving Adam, but they also acknowledge they cannot stay away from each other. Nina also feels that Adam is not over his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who left him for another woman, Anne, after coming out as a lesbian.
Adam, figuring out Kevin is the man sleeping with Nina, confronts him at the bar where Kevin and Rebecca work. Kevin argues Adam was not treating Nina right and claims Adam is not truly in love with her because he has not gotten over his ex. Adam recognizes some truth in what Kevin says, but he still angrily smashes a shot glass against the bar wall before storming out.
Rebecca, being new in town and unlucky in love, meets Anne at a coffee shop. Even though she does not have a serious interest in being a lesbian, she decides to sleep with Anne to see if it excites her more than sleeping with men, which has so far been underwhelming for her. Her first lesbian experience with Anne is interrupted by Kate who returns home early after finally coming out of the closet to her parents. Catching Anne and Rebecca in bed together, Kate walks out. Rebecca, realizing she is not really a lesbian, does not see Anne again out of embarrassment.
Kate is left heartbroken by Anne's transgression. Anne, on the other hand, has been looking for a reason to break it off with Kate, who is the younger of the two and more serious about the relationship. Anne does not like the domestic routine the two have settled into and tells Kate that she has never been very good at monogamy.
After confronting Nina about her affair with Kevin, Adam and Nina break up. Learning Kate is no longer with Anne, Adam sees it as an opportunity to get back together with her, although she tells him it's not possible. Adam meets Rebecca when he picks her up in his cab on her way to a blind date. They recognize each other from his blow-up in the bar and are instantly attracted to each other. Although Rebecca warns Adam that she is not very comfortable with her own body and does not feel terribly connected to it in bed, Rebecca discovers sex with Adam is better than any experience she has had before.
With Nina and Adam's relationship over, Kevin tells Nina that their relationship was not only sex and that he's in love with her. Nina, knowing Kevin's past indiscretions of dumping women after he sleeps with them and loses interest, does not believe his declaration and tells him she does not want to see him again. Meanwhile, Adam and Rebecca are happy until Kate calls him and tells him she wants to get back together and wants him to father a child. He is initially angry with Kate, telling her that her timing is way off and he is now seeing someone else. After thinking it over, he regretfully breaks up with Rebecca to get back with Kate. Hurt, Rebecca tells Adam that she is the one that broke Kate and Anne up when Kate caught the two in bed, saying she supposes Adam leaving her makes her and Kate ""even"". She also tells Adam not to call her when Kate inevitably breaks his heart again.
Kate tries to settle into the rekindled relationship with Adam, but after realizing that she is more attracted to women, she breaks up with him again. However, instead of diving into another relationship, Kate has decided to stay single for now and try to get to know herself. Nina turns up pregnant, but does not know if the baby is Kevin's or Adam's because she slept with both of them in the same night. Kevin still professes his love for Nina, but she is still suspect of his true feelings. Adam finds out she is pregnant, but with the three of them not knowing whose child it is, everything is put on hold. Adam finally goes to Nina's place to have it out with her over who is the father of her baby. He finds Nina and Kevin there together, telling Adam that they have decided to get married. Adam is angry but acquiesces, seeing that Kevin really loves Nina. Nina tells both of them she does not want to know who the biological father of her child is and tells Adam that she and Kevin are going to raise the child. Rebecca, hearing about everything that happened from Kevin, and knowing that Adam would not call her, goes to see him, and the two resume their relationship.","Jon Bon Jovi as Kevin

The robot is then revealed to be one of many others that the inventor has created. The front page of the Daily Planet reports the robot's robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of fifty million dollars of the world's rarest gems at the local museum.

Later, Clark Kent is covering the museum's exhibit for the Planet, though he is greeted by Lois Lane, who intends to cover the story as well. The robot soon resurfaces and infiltrates the museum while the police fail to stop it. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the robot begins loading the jewels into a compartment within its torso. While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois sneaks into the robot's compartment, just as it leaves the museum and takes to the sky. Clark emerges from the booth and notices Lois is gone, before going back into it and becoming Superman.
Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside it. He lands on the robot and struggles to open its compartment, only to have the inventor maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a overhead power line, tangling him in its wires. As the robot is upside down, its compartment opens up and all the jewels fall out in the process, with Lois surviving only by hanging on for dear life until the robot flips back over. As Superman struggles to free himself from the power line's wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of the jewels, the inventor finds Lois inside it. When she refuses to tell the inventor what became the jewels at his demand, the latter prepares to lower her into a pot of molten metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry.
Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the inventor's lair, only to oppose the rest of his robots. Initially, the robots appear to have the upper hand, but Superman is undeterred and soon defeats them, sending the inventor running. When Superman catches up with him, he manages to save Lois in the nick of time when the inventor threatens to drop her into the metal's pot, landing on a ledge below it. The inventor then attempts to douse the duo in the metal, but Superman shields himself and Lois from it using his cape. The inventor, realizing that he has lost, attempts to commit suicide by jumping over the ledge he is standing on, but Superman seizes him and escapes from the lair with Lois in tow. The next issue of the Planet details the robots' vanquishments, the stolen jewels and money's recovery and the inventor being brought to justice for his crimes. In the office, Clark compliments Lois for her story, to which she remarks that she owed it all to Superman.","Bud Collyer as Clark Kent / Superman, a police officer and the inventor of the titular robots

That night, Winifred's strict and ambitious husband George returns home from his job at the bank (""The Life I Lead"") and places a newspaper advertisement for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kind, sympathetic nanny (""The Perfect Nanny""), but George rips up their letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace. A strong wind draws the scraps up through the chimney and into the sky.
The next day, several sour-faced nannies await outside the Banks family's home, but a strong gust of wind magically blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young woman using an umbrella as a parachute to gracefully descend from the sky. The woman enters the Banks family's home and introduces herself as Mary Poppins. To George's shock, Mary is holding the children's advertisement, and the scraps have been put back together. She agrees with the advertisement's requests but promises George that she will be firm with his children. Mary manipulates George into hiring her. Upstairs, Mary helps the children magically clean their nursery (""A Spoonful of Sugar"").
While walking in a park, the trio encounters Mary's friend Bert, a jack of all trades working as a street painter. Mary transports the group into one of Bert's drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary and Bert sing while strolling (""Jolly Holiday""). Bert and Mary then participate in a horse race, which Mary wins. Mary uses a nonsense word to describe her victory (""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious""). When a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, the group is returned to London. While putting the children to bed, Mary sings a lullaby (""Stay Awake"").
The next day, the trio and Bert visit Mary's odd uncle, Albert, whose uncontrollable laughter has caused him to float (""I Love to Laugh""). George becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary. She persuades him to take the children to his workplace. That evening, Mary sings a lullaby about a woman who sells bird food on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral (""Feed the Birds""). The next day at the bank, the children meet George's boss, the elderly Mr. Dawes Sr., who advises Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching the coin out of Michael's hand (""Fidelity Fiduciary Bank""). Michael demands it back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a bank run.
Jane and Michael flee the bank and get lost in the East End. Bert, now working as a chimney sweep, escorts them home (""Chim Chim Cher-ee""). The three and Mary venture onto the rooftops, where Bert dances with other chimney sweeps (""Step in Time""). George later receives a phone call from the bank, requesting a meeting with him regarding Michael's actions. The children overhear the phone call and become concerned. Bert scolds George for neglecting Jane and Michael and advises him to spend more time with them before they grow up (""A Man Has Dreams""). Hoping to make amends, Michael gives George the tuppence. Stricken with regret, George slowly walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering. Lost for words, George exclaims ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"", tells a joke Uncle Albert had told the children, and happily walks home. When Mr. Dawes Sr. understands the joke, he floats up into the air, laughing.
The next day, Mary Poppins tells the children she must leave. George mends his children's kite and takes the family out to fly it. At the park, the family encounters Mr. Dawes Sr.'s son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals that his father died laughing at the joke (""Let's Go Fly a Kite""). Mr. Dawes Jr. says his father had never been happier and gratefully rehires (and promotes) George. Mary watches the family and decides her work is done. As Mary flies away, Bert looks up and says, ""Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.""",

Japanese firm Hosaka hires Fox and X to help Hiroshi defect, offering a fee of $50 million. Fox and X hire Sandii, a small-time nightclub singer and call girl in Shinjuku, to help persuade Hiroshi to defect to a newly outfitted Hosaka lab in Marrakech.
While training her for the extraction, X falls in love with Sandii, who offers conflicting accounts of her past. Fox and X meet with representatives from Hosaka and negotiate their fee up to $100 million. Sandii meets Hiroshi in Vienna and persuades him to leave his wife and defect to Hosaka. Fox then travels to Marrakech to await Hiroshi's arrival, and X arranges to spend a night with Sandii in Berlin before her rendezvous in Marrakech.
Sandii proposes that she and X leave Fox, marry, and live together. X offers to discuss it after Sandii visits Marrakech. That night, while Sandii sleeps, X rummages through her personal effects, finding cash, information about her aliases, and an unmarked computer chip.
Hosaka transfers the agreed-upon $100 million fee. Fox returns from Marrakech, and X informs him that he will be meeting Sandii in Shinjuku to start a new life with her, a plan that Fox begrudgingly accepts.

Keefe tracks her down in New York City, where he finds her at a nude modeling shoot. He chases her into the street, forcing her into his car. They arrive at her apartment where he shows her film footage of their son. Andrea escapes the interrogation, fleeing to the home of Christopher Neville, a film director who has promised her a role in his upcoming picture. Neville is a disgruntled filmmaker who has recently returned to New York from Los Angeles after his last film was cancelled over budgetary disputes. Neville and Andrea are about to have a sexual encounter, but they get into an argument and he strangles her to death; her murder is caught entirely on camera from a camera he has hidden in the room.
After Andrea's body is found in Coney Island, police immediately suspect Keefe of her murder and he is arrested. Neville, however, ingratiates himself with Keefe by buying him an attorney and earning him his freedom; Neville claims to have witnessed Keefe's arrest on the street and become fascinated by his and Andrea's stories. Neville tells Keefe he wants his next film to be based on Andrea's life. Keefe, initially reluctant, agrees to help Neville as a technical advisor. At a local Salvation Army, Keefe meets Elaine Bernstein, a directionless woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Andrea. He brings her to meet Neville, who casts her in the film as Andrea. Neville brutally strangles Leon Gruskin, a snarky film lab assistant, to death before having dinner with Elaine to solidify her contract.
During the film shoot, Keefe becomes upset when the actor portraying him reveals he had sex with the real Andrea, and assaults him. Later, Elaine visits Keefe, and the two end up having sex. Neville ultimately decides to fire the actor and cast Keefe in the film, playing himself. At the end of the shoot, Keefe uncovers Neville's film reel containing Andrea's murder. Keefe attempts to view the footage with Elaine, but is prevented by doing so when Neville arrives, and he damages the negatives in the process.
Neville shows to Det. Delroy a recently shot love scene between Keefe and Elaine, willingly pointing out a spousicide-related detail which compromises the already delicate position of the young widower. In light of this new evidence, Delroy tells the director that he will arrest the young man very soon. Neville telephones Keefe to warn him, telling him to come to his house at a certain time. The director also calls Elaine to his home, where he attempts to recreate the night of Andrea's murder, this time using Elaine. Det. Vickers watches Elaine enter the director's house from the street, but he misses Keefe, who breaks in through a window. He disrupts the liaison by pulling plug fuses out of the breaker box, shutting off the lights. Detective Vickers notices the lights shut off from the street and unsuccessfully tries to break in. In the house, Neville attacks Keefe with a pair of scissors, and the two struggle. Keefe throws Neville over a balcony, and he lands in an indoor fountain below together with a light. Simultaneously, Elaine restores electricity to the house, unknowingly electrocuting Neville to death.
Shortly after, Keefe and Elaine arrive at the airport to board a plane to Dallas. There, Elaine plans to assume Andrea's identity for the sake of Keefe and Andrea's son, and start a new life.","Zoë Lund as Andrea Wilcox / Elaine Bernstein

29528534,/m/04j0lfk,Anokha Rishta,,180.0,['hindi'],1986-01-01,['India'],['India'],,,"Anokha Rishta is the story of an unusual relationship between Mary and Robert Brown. Mary is a 19-year-old orphan and lives in an orphanage run by nuns. She scores 92.5% in her last year and is artistically talented. Until her adulthood, her school education was being sponsored by a philanthropist. Her sponsor, a rich old man whom she has never met, but has only corresponded with through the nuns, passes away, leaving her dreams of a college education in shambles. Though she has never met her sponsor, she is never given the name of that old man by Mother Superior, chief of the orphanage. Mother Superior is aware that Mary and the old man used to write to each other and that Mary respected and loved him a lot. That old deceased sponsor's son says he is not interested in funding the college education of Mary. Mother Superior then decides to find a new sponsor for her education, but since it would take a further month to find a new sponsor, by which time the admission process would be over in colleges, Mother decides to convince the old man's son. Mother Superior meets with his son Robert 'Bob' Brown to continue to sponsor her college education till the orphanage finds a solution to what Mary will do in future. 
Bob, who is now at the helm of his father's business, agrees to continue her sponsorship only after consulting his father's trusted aid Nasir Khan, who makes Robert go through files containing letters written by Mary to his father over the years. Mother Superior advises Mary that in the city college and city hostel, she would not tell any one that she is an orphan and that she must say her parents are staying in Dubai. Meanwhile, Bob also insists to Mother Superior that Mary should not be told of his uncle's death so that Mary keeps writing letters to him and he can read them compassionately and fulfill all her wishes. Bob does not know how Mary looks, but keeps receiving letters from Mary asking for new pens, new dresses, etc. Mother Superior tells Mary that she would not give away the mail address or the photo of her sponsor as the sponsor wants to keep it that way and that's why the actual sponsor never came to meet Mary in person, but Mary can still write letters to her sponsor and deliver it to Mother Superior, who will post it to his residence. Bob is a good looking bachelor, who is a rich businessman, aged above 40 and Mary falls in love with him after meeting him few times accompanying Sweary, a classmate of Mary and Bob's niece.
Mary does not know him by face. Also neither Bob's dad nor Bob know Mary's face. Alex introduces his brother Bill to  Bob, and on Bob's advice Bill starts working in his firm. Bill is immature and along with his friends makes a trip to a famous doctor Dr. Miss Padma Kapoor and he tells her he has a problem with his reproductive organ. Doctor Padma realises that this 20-something guy is lying and asks his real name. On knowing his real name, Padma asks Bill is he not the younger brother of Alex? Now Bill asks for forgiveness and runs away. Bill asks his sister-in-law about the life of Robert Brown and asks why when Alex has married, Bob is unmarried? Beena explains it to him saying he was in love with Doctor Padma, but the couple decided they won't go against their respective father's wishes and so till date both are unmarried. 
At Sweary's birthday party, Robert Bob notices that Mary is wearing the same things which he had sent to the girl in the orphanage, but does not read too much into this as Mary had told them her parents are in Dubai. In the same birthday party, Bill meets Mary and falls in love with her, but her heart has already fallen for Robert, still without knowing that he is her sponsor, and she rejects Bill each time he proposes to her. Meanwhile, Bill keeps facing trouble in the office while he is learning things on the job and faces taunts from Nasir Khan regularly. Bill gets dejected after numerous attempts to impress Mary fail and starts working sincerely in Bob's company as an employee. Mary, being madly in love with Robert without knowing that he himself is her sponsor and ""her uncle"", whom she writes to regularly and gets letters from, keeps on living in her dreamy world of a married life with Robert. Her problem is that she cannot share her feelings and mental agony (of not getting a positive response from Robert) with ""her uncle"" because all the incoming and outgoing letters of Mary are screened first by Mother Superior.
Meanwhile, Bill gets help and tips from Robert on how to win a young woman's heart. Bill tells Bob that he is in love with Mary. Alex and his wife are also happy that Bill has matured and fallen in love with a girl. Alex asks Bob to unite Bill and Mary. A picnic is arranged by Bob to which all are invited, but Bill does not turn up as he is angry with Mary and Mary comes to the picnic only to spend time with Bob. She proposes to Bob and Robert replies that had he got married at the right age he would have had a daughter of Mary's age. He explains to her that had Mary been of the age of say, 25–26 or if he himself had been of that age, this love affair could have worked out. Later Mary finds that Robert has no feelings for her. Bill confuses her by telling her that Robert and Dr. Padma were in love for a long time and that they knew each other since school days. But they couldn't marry because Robert's father and Padma's parents were opposed to their alliance as their religions were different. At that young age of 20–22 Bob's dad had given him two choices: either to stay with him and marry a girl from their Christian community or leave the house and marry Padma. Robert decided not to hurt his dad's sentiments and decided not to marry. Similarly, Padma had decided they would remain friends and concentrate only on their careers. Mary is extremely frustrated after hearing this and in a fit of rage goes to Padma and lies to her that she is pregnant with Robert's baby. Padma is shocked at this and goes to Bob's office and scolds him for his irresponsibility but Robert tells her that it was not him. He calls Mary to his office and shouts at her thinking that she is pregnant with Bill's baby and lied to the doctor that she was pregnant with his baby, but she tells him that she was lying to break them up and also to prove her love for him and tells him that she cannot live without him.
Then Mother Superior tells Robert that Mary was going to be sent to Italy to learn music and also that Mary was allowed to become a nun as Mary expressed a wish to become a nun to her. But as a last wish Mary wants to see her unknown sponsor before leaving for Italy. Mother Superior then asks Robert whether he would like to meet Mary and disclose he is the sponsor to Mary, to which Robert replies he would not like to meet her. Mary does not want be a nun out of her own choice, but only because Robert is adamant of not ever marrying Mary and this fact is hidden from Mother Superior. Finally, when Robert breaks her heart (in her own interest only) and she decides to become a nun, Mary writes a final letter to ""her uncle"" with a special and last request to the head of the orphanage to deliver it to him without opening it and reading its contents. Dr. Padma, knowing all these developments, tries to stop Mary, but she remains firm on her decision. Then Padma advises Robert that decisions should never be postponed. Padma says years ago both of them did not have the courage to take a decision and are unmarried, but now he should not repeat the same thing and so needs to take a decision in the best interests of Mary and so he should marry her. Finally the responsibility falls on the shoulders of Robert to do something to prevent Mary from taking this drastic step of becoming a Nun and that leads to the highly emotional and impressive climax. So as a final meeting she sees Robert and tells him about this and that she cannot see him any more. She also meets Bill and tells him everything including that she is an orphan and that she is going to be a nun and that she had lied that her parents were in Dubai and asks Bill to move on. Bill, however, still is willing to marry her but she tells him that she is in love with someone else and since that man did not accept her, she decided to become a nun. He insists her to tell him who he is and she tells him that it is Robert. Now Bill also gets desperate upon knowing this decision of hers. This results in a misunderstanding between Bob and Bill. At this piece of news, he goes to Robert's office and yells at him for what he did. Robert then, as soon as Mary is about to leave from the orphanage, comes there and tells Mother Superior that Mary is making the decision to be a nun unwillingly and that she is in love with Bob himself, though Bill loves Mary and that as the sponsor he would like to meet her. Bob reveals that he was the sponsor (her uncle) that was unknown to her for so long and comforts her and says that he wants her to marry Bill.",

Before doing that, however, he returns home to Riverdale for his high school reunion and in an attempt to save his friend Pop Tate's diner.
Archie and company are all now in their early thirties, with the trials and tribulations one might expect to have happened to such as a group over the years:

Betty, a grade school teacher, has had problems finding permanent employment, and may or may not have relationship issues.
Veronica, having lived in France since graduation, has been married (and divorced) four times to very wealthy men.
Jughead, now a successful psychiatrist, is also divorced (although only once), and now has sole custody of a son named Jordan. Due to the divorce and other failed relationships, Jughead carries emotional baggage that manifests itself in a terrible fear of women. A running gag in the movie is Jughead's desperation to avoid seeing Big Ethel during his visit to Riverdale. This is played for laughs at the end when at the reunion it turns out that Big Ethel is no longer the gangly, awkward teenager she once was but is now a striking beauty and still has a crush on Jughead.
Moose and Midge have gotten married and become chiropractors. They also have a son, Max, who hits it off with Jordan.
Reggie is a successful gym owner and owns a car lot.
When Archie sees Betty and Veronica for the first time in fifteen years, all his old feelings for them come flooding back, threatening his engagement—and it does not help that the girls renew their pursuit of Archie, heedless of the fact that he has a fiancée. Meanwhile, Archie also tries to keep Reggie, helped along by an uncharacteristically menacing Mr. Lodge, from evicting Pop Tate from his soda shop, under the pretext of expanding his gym. Hiram Lodge does not want Archie near Veronica and still thinks they are wrong for each other. Archie ultimately saves the Chock'lit Shoppe, though he loses Pam  to Robert, who Betty dumps after growing sick of his bullying, and decides to stay in Riverdale. Archie and Pam break up and decide to stay in Riverdale where he belongs. Veronica, Betty, and Jughead decide to move back to Riverdale as well. Reggie sees the error of his ways and reconciles with his friends as they take a group photo along with Jordan by Pops.","Almost all of the characters in the movie are regular or recurring characters in the originating comics:

Adding to the comic tone are the accents from the stormtroopers which is very reminiscent to the accents heard in the movie Fargo.
A small visual gag near the beginning of the film is that the stolen Imperial droid recovered from the Jawas is a replica of Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000.
In TROOPS there is a notable alternate (tongue-in-cheek) take on the deaths of Luke Skywalker's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, presenting their fate as the result of a domestic dispute gone too far, rather than execution at the hands of Imperial forces. Indeed, the spotlighted members of Black Sheep Squadron attempt to mediate the dispute before Beru makes a disastrous move with a thermal detonator.

25960460,/m/0b6kc_5,Daddy and Them,,101.0,['english'],2001-01-01,"['United States of America', 'Netherlands']","['United States of America', 'Netherlands']",,,"Daddy and Them is a 2001 American comedy-drama film written, directed by, and starring Billy Bob Thornton. In addition to Thornton, it stars John Prine, Laura Dern, Andy Griffith, Ben Affleck, Kelly Preston, Diane Ladd, Brenda Blethyn, Tuesday Knight, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jim Varney in his final film appearance before his death in February 2000.
Daddy and Them was filmed in 1998 in the wake of Thornton’s success with Sling Blade and was originally planned as a theatrical release. The release was ultimately delayed by Miramax, who found the film not ""commercial"" enough. The film debuted at the Newport International Film Festival on June 6, 2001. Miramax eventually aired the film on Showtime in January 2003 and released it on DVD on January 13, 2004.

Plot synopsis
Ruby and Claude Montgomery are a very insecure and jealous couple who must reunite with extended family in Arkansas when Claude's Uncle Hazel is jailed for attempted murder. The couple travels with Ruby's older sister Rose, with whom Claude had a previous relationship, and Ruby and Rose's mother Jewel, who continuously talks about Rose and Claude's past relationship, which irritates Ruby.

Cast
Production
The film was shot in Arkansas from August to October 1998. Filming locations included various sites around Little Rock, including Pinnacle Mountain State Park and the interior of the Arkansas State Capitol.
The song from the same-titled album ""In Spite of Ourselves"" used during the closing credits was performed by John Prine and Iris DeMent.

Release
Daddy and Them initially had a theatrical release date planned for sometime in late 1999 or early 2000. The release date was pushed back as Miramax wanted All the Pretty Horses, a studio film Thornton was directing at the time, to debut first. It continued to sit on the shelf long after Horses premiered in late 2000. Thornton has commented that friction with Miramax during the production of Horses played a role in the shelving of Daddy and Them.
The film had its world premiere at the Newport International Film Festival on June 6, 2001.

Reception
Daddy and Them holds an 86% rating based on 7 reviews on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.
Eddie Cockrell of Variety wrote, ""Beneath its deadpan and often absurdist exterior, Daddy and Them feels like a very personal piece of work about how family really does come first, warts and all."" Brad Slager of Film Threat was more critical, writing, ”Plotless and pedantic, Daddy and Them is supposed to be a lighthearted look at family dysfunction in the Deep South, but the characters are not enjoyable enough to care about.""

One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is thrown out of an aeroplane by a pilot and falls to the ground unbroken. Initially, Xi's people assume the bottle to be a gift from their gods, just as they believe plants and animals are, and find many uses for it. Unlike other gifts, however, there is only one glass bottle, which causes unforeseen conflict within the tribe. As a result, Xi decides to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and dispose of the divisive object.
Along the way, Xi encounters biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the local wildlife; Steyn's assistant and mechanic, M'pudi; Kate Thompson, a woman who quit her job as a journalist in Johannesburg to become a village school teacher; and eventually a band of fugitive guerrillas led by Sam Boga. In the fictitious state Biryani, northwest of Botswana, Boga's men have killed three cabinet members and injured two others in an attempt on the president's life, sending the military in hot pursuit.
Steyn is tasked with bringing Thompson to the village where she will teach, but he is awkward and clumsy around her. Their Land Rover stalls while trying to ford a deep river; he hoists it out with a winch, but it continues lifting the vehicle to a very high treetop level while a forgetful Steyn is distracted extricating Thompson from a wait-a-bit tree. She more than once mistakes his attempts to evade wild animals, and putting out an evening campfire, as advances towards her. Eventually, a snobbish safari tour guide named Jack Hind arrives and takes Thompson the rest of the way to the village.
One day, Xi happens upon a herd of goats and, believing them to be wild animals, shoots one with a tranquilizer arrow, planning to eat it. The goatherd has him arrested, and he is sentenced to jail. M'pudi, who once lived with the San and can speak their language, is discontent with the verdict. He and Steyn arrange to hire Xi as a tracker for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison time, and teach Xi how to drive Steyn's Land Rover. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Thompson's school, taking her and the students as hostages as they make their escape to a neighbouring country.
Steyn, M'pudi and Xi, immersed in their fieldwork, find that they are along the terrorists' and children's path. They manage to immobilize six of the eight guerrillas using makeshift tranquilizer darts launched by Xi with a miniature bow, allowing Thompson and the children to confiscate the guerillas' firearms. Steyn and M'pudi apprehend the remaining two guerrillas by frightening one with a snake and by shooting at a tree above the other, causing latex to drip from the tree and irritate his skin. Hind arrives and takes Thompson and the children away, taking credit for the rescue that Steyn, M'pudi and Xi had actually planned and executed.
Later, with Xi's term over, Steyn pays his wages and sends him on his way. Having never seen money before, Xi discards it. Steyn and M'pudi then drive from their camp to visit Thompson, where Steyn attempts to explain his tendency to be uncoordinated in her presence, but accidentally and repeatedly knocks over a number of objects in the process. Thompson finds his efforts endearing, and kisses Steyn.
Xi eventually arrives at the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. Convinced that he has reached the edge of the world, he throws the bottle off the cliff and returns to his family.",Director Jamie Uys appears in an uncredited role as the Reverend.

He is fascinated by the fact that she moans silently, involuntarily orgasms, but does not cry out or let people know she is being sexually molested. When Hada is transferred to Los Angeles, he has too much to drink at a business party and tries to imitate what he saw by groping a Caucasian school girl while riding a crowded bus. But unlike the Japanese woman that Hada saw in Japan, the American girl screams. Hada runs away, but is robbed and beaten by a mugger. Meanwhile, several innocent Asian men are beaten by bystanders who suspect that one of them is the man who groped the girl.
The girl happens to be Rita Crowe, the daughter of an LAPD vice-squad detective, Lt. Crowe, an officer with a strong sense of justice who is very protective of her. Shortly afterward, Fumiko, Hada's daughter, is kidnapped into a child prostitution ring led by the infamous ""Pimp King"" Duke. Crowe, who has developed a general dislike of the Japanese due to his daughter's incident, is assigned against his will to find the girl. His feelings about Japanese people start to change when he realizes that the Hadas care about their daughter as intensely as he cares for his daughter.
Crowe and his partner, Eddie Rios, eventually find Fumiko and rescue her from the pimp and his gang. They kill one member of the gang, but the others escape. The Hadas visit Crowe's house with gifts to show their appreciation for his work. Rita recognizes Hiroshi as the man who groped her on the bus—and he recognizes her—but neither one says anything. However, despite this apparently happy ending, Fumiko has been so traumatized by her experiences as a prostitute—she was raped by Duke and his gang members and then sold to customers of both sexes—that she commits suicide by an overdose.
Crowe and Rios decide to find Duke, and locate him on a boat in a harbor. In the ensuing fight, Duke and his remaining gang members kill Rios, but Duke eventually ends up in the harbor. Since Duke can't swim, Crowe has the option to let the gangster drown, but ends up dragging him out. However, as a way of ""poetic justice"", Crowe has Duke interned in a prison wing inhabited by sexually aggressive inmates; his designated cellmate makes several sexual allusions, leading Duke to realize that he is intent on raping him.

Suddenly, his vicious chief minister, Maan Singh, backstabs him by mingling with a dacoit, Shamsher Jung, and captures the fort. During that plight, Dharam Singh entrusts the princes to his allegiant Shambu and his wife Nandini, and they split.

Sydow and Nørby speak in their native Swedish and Danish languages respectively, though there is a scene where he speaks English and several where she speaks German; the rest of the cast speak Norwegian or German.
The film won the Guldbagge Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Sydow), Best Actress (Nørby) and Best Screenplay (Enquist). The film was selected as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 69th Academy Awards, but was not shortlisted as a nominee.

Production
The plans for the film have a history from 1979, when Thorkild Hansen, the author of the book Processen mod Hamsun contacted Troell since he wanted him to direct a Norwegian television series based on the book. Max von Sydow was meant to do the part as Hamsun already then, but NRK dropped out on the project in the belief that it would be too controversial.
Fourteen years later, in 1993, von Sydow brought the project back to life when he got the Danish production company Nordisk Film interested in adapting the book, this time with Per Olov Enquist, who had written Troell's previous film Il Capitano, providing the screenplay.
The shooting took place during the spring and the summer of 1995, with a budget of around 40 million SEK. The most expensive scene filmed, in which Marie Hamsun witnesses the attack and the sinking of the German cruiser Blücher in the Oslofjord at the Battle of Drøbak Sound on 9 April 1940, was cut from the finished product.

Release
The film was initially meant to be released in the autumn 1996 at the Venice Film Festival, but was brought forward to the spring as Norwegian television would release another film about Hamsun the same year. It also saved the film from having to compete against Bille August's historical epic Jerusalem.
During the Swedish release Troell and the producer heavily criticized the distributor, Svensk Filmindustri, for the sloppy handling of the film, something he had also experienced with his previous film Il Capitano.

In 1863, Napoleon III of France, fearful he will lose Mexico to Juárez, circumvents the Monroe Doctrine by instituting sovereign rule and controlling an election that places Maximilian von Habsburg on the Mexican throne.
Upon his arrival in the country with his wife Carlota (Bette Davis), Maxmilian realizes he is expected to establish French supremacy by confiscating land that Juárez had returned to the native people and penalizing the rebels under his command. Maximilian decides to abdicate his throne but is deterred from doing so by Carlota.
Maximillian offers Juárez the position of prime minister, but Juárez's refusal to compromise democratic self-rule for the Mexican people creates an unbridgeable rift between the two. When the American Civil War comes to an end, the United States warns Napoleon that it intends to enforce the Monroe Doctrine by military force if necessary, sending arms in support of Juárez's army. Their efforts are thwarted by Vice President Alejandro Uradi (Joseph Calleia), who seizes the American ammunition and therefore virtually guarantees victory for Maximilian. However, Napoleon orders all French troops to evacuate Mexico, leaving Maximilian without an army.
Angered by this move, Carlota returns to Paris to appeal to Napoleon, but she suffers a mental breakdown. Juárez and his rebels capture Maxmillian and his men. Although arrangements to set him free are made, he insists on remaining with his supporters. Tried and found guilty, they are sentenced to death by firing squad.",

24399617,/m/07s63_7,Bruce Lee: The Lost Interview,,30.0,['english'],1994-11-02,['Canada'],['Canada'],,,"Bruce Lee: The Lost Interview is the name given to the 9 December 1971 edition of The Pierre Berton Show, which featured martial artist/actor Bruce Lee in his only English speaking television interview. Its title is derived from its status; it was presumed lost for several years until its rediscovery and airing on 2 November 1994. Over the course of the interview, which was filmed in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee and Pierre Berton discuss Lee's career, various aspects of martial arts philosophy and the inherent problems faced by an Asian in pursuing stardom in Hollywood. A review of the interview by Bill Stockey said that Bruce Lee's ""human side is exposed and he is portrayed as more approachable"".

Interview summary
In the first few minutes of the interview, Bruce Lee asserts that he speaks Cantonese and reveals that he does not actually speak Mandarin despite his successes starring in many Mandarin movies. He discloses the fact that he just mouths the words while they shoot the Mandarin film, but someone else's voice is played over his for when the final movie is released.
Berton asks about Bruce Lee's career in terms of his shift from martial arts to his role as an actor in various movies, to which Lee says that he never expected that his love of martial art would lead to him becoming an actor in movies. Bruce Lee goes further into his martial arts career and talks about how it shaped him into the person he has become (as an actor, martial artist, and human being). Lee also asserts that he has never had a stunt double in any movie that he has acted in.
Berton then questions him about his acting career and the martial arts school that he set in up in Hollywood. Bruce Lee explains that he set up the school to teach martial arts like judo, karate, and Chinese boxing to people like James Garner, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, and James Coburn in order to help them to learn how to express their feelings (e.g. anger, determination, pride or happiness) through movements of the body. Lee says that the school was not set up to train people for acting roles, but rather to teach the art of expressing the human body in combated form (he also demonstrates the different types of combat movements as he speaks).
Lee also talks about his future career in Hollywood and discusses which series he is going to be in. He talks about the differences in Western and Eastern media that he noticed, such as the likelihood of violence occurring more often in Western films in day-to-day activities. When talking about Western media, he says that there is a lack of the true oriental person being portrayed in the media i.e. there are constant depictions of stereotypes (e.g. pigtails, slim eyes) in Western media.
Berton asks about the problems he has faced as an Asian in Western society in terms of fears of not being accepted by Western audiences, and Lee says it is not a strange occurrence to be unaccepted because it is even seen as a business risk for most film producers. This is because of the idea that the general audience will perceive the actor as foreign. He explains that it is the same in Asia when a foreigner is seen in the media. He also says that when he does Chinese films, he tries not to act as Western as he normally would because he wouldn't want to be perceived as different from other Chinese people. However, when he goes back to the United States, it is the other way around because he is perceived as an exotic person so the film producers try to get him to do things for the sake of being exotic or foreign.
Berton also asks if Lee considers himself American or Chinese to which he explains that he would like to think of himself as a human being. He says:

""You know what I think of myself? As a human being, because I mean I don't want to be like as Confucius say, but under the sky, under the heavens, there is but one family. It just so happens that people are different.""

The enhanced venom cures a woman of breast cancer. The snakes, however, eventually destroy their cages and murder four people before being contained. Mr. Staffin shows up without notice, subdues the staff and orders his own men to load the snakes. Dr. Akim manages to shoot the glass of the tank, releasing the snakes, before Staffin shoots him with a sleep dart. The snakes kill everybody except Staffin, who escapes.
Dr. Vera Collins learns that there has been a break-in at one of the Universal Bio Tech facilities, where the snakes were enhanced without her knowledge or approval. She thinks that this was unethical.
The snakes repopulate at an increasing rate. Meanwhile, on the island of Eden Cove, a newlywed couple is murdered on a beach. The bodies are found by a young man named Cal Taylor and Hank Brownie, a local who notices a rental jeep with the doors wide open. They find the woman's wedding ring and take it to Sheriff Tom Hendricks. He walks in on Jack, who owns an inn, and Georgie, who owns the car rental, flirting and asks Georgie to check on the info for the jeep. He shows disdain for their tomfoolery because Jack is still only separated from his wife and Tom's friend, Ellie. Jack helps Cal check into the inn, but gets interrupted by Ellie and their teenage daughter Maggie. Maggie accuses Jack of sleeping around and says that she refuses to move and start over at a new school before running off. Meanwhile, Cal has come to Eden to see Doc Jim Silverton, bringing things from the latter's deceased son Joey. Doc mourns the fact Joey's remains cannot be transferred to the states to be buried. Sheriff Tom then calls, saying that Maggie broke into Nicky's place and smoked marihuana. When Doc and Cal get to The Garden, owner Nicky, Maggie, Ellie and Jack are arguing. Doc is retiring and Cal may take over for him.
Ellie and Nicky fight before they hear screaming outside from a woman named Emily Willis. Her child, Jake, was bitten by a snake. Nicky rushes Cal and Jake to the clinic. There, Cal injects Jake with antivenom, stabilizing him. Doc leaves town to take Jake to a hospital with Cal subbing in for him, and Nicky is taken to prison for growing marihuana. Meanwhile, Vera tells Burton that she only has a limited supply of C12, which will only immobilize the snakes temporarily. However, C12 will also kill humans. Burton says that she needs to examine Jake's bite and determine if it comes from one of their vipers, and to contain the problem on Eden if so. He then introduces Jon Staffin as his security chief and sends them out. On Eden, Jack drives Maggie back to the inn. She gets angry when Georgie appears and storms off. Maggie walks past Hank Brownie as he reels in a half eaten dead fish out of the water. Brownie mentions that he has never seen anything like it.
Sheriff Tom visits Cal at the clinic while he is patching up Ellie, who insists on pressing charges against Nicky for assault. Tom asks if she is overreacting, and Ellie accuses him of having feelings for Nicky, but he denies it. Doc calls Cal, saying that Jake is getting worse, and that the bite had an unusual amount of venom in it, and says that while they have no more antivenom, he will be back in the morning and they should be fine. When they get off the phone, Vera and Staffin ask to speak to Doc. Jack and Georgie, who have just had sex, are in the inn and Georgie is attempting to sleep while Jack showers. Georgie thinks that Jack is teasing her again, but is attacked by the vipers and killed. Tom takes Cal to examine Nicky, still in prison. They speak about Joey, and Nicky shows remorse about his death and the fight they had before he enlisted and left, ultimately leading to his death. Cal later exits, leaving his tools, which Nicky uses to escape. Brownie shows Tom the lake, full of half devoured fish carcasses. At the inn, Jack finishes dressing in the restroom and enters the room to find Georgie's body. Cal and Nicky stumble upon Jack in a panic state, and Cal saves Nicky from a viper. They carry Jack's body away because Georgie's body is covered in vipers.
At the lake, Tom finds more vipers, and unknowingly tells everyone to run for the hotel, however Maggie runs the wrong way and does not reach the inn. The snakes intrude the lobby, where everyone is hiding, but Cal scares them off with a fire extinguisher. Against Tom's orders, Ellie leaves to find Maggie. She finds her, but they get surrounded on the bridge. Tom appeats and saves Maggie, who cannot walk, and locks her in the safe room at the sheriff's office. The snakes kill Tom, and Jack saves Ellie. They get cornered outside the office, but Cal and Nicky once more use the extinguisher to deter the snakes while they all hide in a van. Cal jumps out of the van and uses the extinguisher while rescuing Maggie and returning to the van, but Cal gets bitten in the process. The van refuses to start and they have to run a café's back entrance, but Ellie gets attacked, and Cal barricades himself, Maggie, and Nicky into the backroom of the cafe using ice, inferring that they do not like the cold. Meanwhile, Doc, Staffin and Vera reach the island and find snakes eating dozens of corpses. En route to the inn, they use grenades of C12 to subdue the snakes. Jack, who is alive, finds Maggie, Nicky and Cal and takes them to the inn also. One of the men with the rescue, Simpson, is killed by a snake, and Vera is repulsed by Staffin's order to move on.
Everyone meets up at the inn, but rescue is not coming until morning. The townspeople are restless and try to leave using the boat Bio Tech arrived on. This leads to a fight in which Jack gets shot. The townspeople leave the inn while Maggie has to be pulled away by Cal. Many are attacked while attemptting to reach the boats. The remainder retreat back to the inn. Jack succumbs to his injuries despite Cal's efforts. The snakes later try to get in. Doc kills one, and they try to barricade the doors. One of Staffin's men, Lewison, cracks and tells the truth, that they were not there to rescue the town, they were sent to gather vipers and take them back, and that aircraft were coming in the morning to gas the entire island, killing everyone left by then.
Cal, Doc, and Vera plan to lure the snakes off the boat, call off the airstrike and escape. Staffin secretly scolds Lewison for revealing plans and reveals that there is a contingency plan. Maggie guides everyone downstairs to where her dad stores a truck, and they attach any heat sources they can to it. Cal tells Maggie to help Doc get to the boats so he can call off the airstrike. Lewison drives the truck while Cal, Staffin, Nicky, Vera and Brownie attract the snakes with heat and guide them to the greenhouse, where Cal plans to trap and kill them. Doc guides the rest of the townspeople to the boats and tries to get ahold of the truck over the walkie talkies, but does not get a response. Maggie takes off but Doc cannot chase after her and departs with the boat. The truck succeeded in guiding the snakes to the greenhouse, and they rush inside. Lewison is bitten, and Maggie appears with more C12 to temporarily subdue the snakes, saving Cal. Vera uses fertilizer and gasoline to create bombs while the snakes weaken the glass until they eventually get in. Staffin gets bitten and, when he dies, they realize he had a radio on him the entire time. He was planning to escape by himself and leave everyone else to die. Vera demands Burton to call the attack off, but he thanks her for her scientific sacrifice and turns his radio off. Cal tries to radio Homeland Security, but they say that Eden is under quarantine and the radio gets jammed by Bio Tech. Brownie accidentally shoots and cracks the glass roof and the snakes begin climbing in, killing Brownie.
Nicky and Vera use flares and propane tanks to ignite the greenhouse, causing an explosion. They see the aircraft coming, but realize that Doc got through when they do not gas the island. Meanwhile, Burton is giving a speech about Bio Tech's profits to interviewers when his walkie talkie conversation with Vera admitting his plan to kill everyone to cover himself is played over the intercom. Burton is arrested. Cal made the recording and was playing it over their speaker system through his computer. Burton is out on bail and gets into a vehicle while on the phone making plans to make everything disappear when he is killed by a snake hiding in his car.","Tara Reid as Nicky Swift

Now that they are alone on the island, Philip constructs a large hut for his wife and himself and a little hut for Henry, but before long Henry is suggesting they share not only food and water but Susan as well.
Opposed to this, Susan nevertheless is offended by Philip's indifferent reaction to Henry's indecent proposal.

He awaits Susan's decision on whether the men should change huts or share and share alike.

Although severely wounded, he survives despite being showered with bullets by the police. Dr. Giri, a senior surgeon take pity on the escaped criminal who is to be hanged for his crime. Manu is accused to having murdered his elder brother and sister-in-law out of lust for the latter, in an attempted rape. For various reasons Dr. Giri believes Manu to be innocent. He convinces his friend Shekharan, the Chief Minister of Kerala, to re-open the case and assign the case to a sincere and brilliant, yet aggressive police officer Ashok Nariman.
Initially termed ""hopeless"" by the legal advisors — due to the excellent way the case was framed — Nariman find loopholes . He learns that the crime was committed by the intelligent Adv. Padhmanabhan Thampi and his friends Kochunarayanan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Philippose and their allies including Musthafa Kamal (a.k.a. Karate Kamal) — who executed the crime. Nariman submit his report and the case comes to the Sessions Court. To everyone's dismay, the Judge refuses to have a second hearing of the case — as earlier the case had gone up to Supreme Court awarding capital punishment and even the President of India did not have any pity on the ""perpetrator"" Manu so as to pardon his sentence. The Judge believes the case to be a publicity stunt as the result of the change in Government and the Court cannot be deceived by any.
Disappointed at the happenings, Nariman takes over a new case — Ammini missing case. Ammini was an ally, a prostitute, a pimp and an outlet for the illegal liquor dealings of Kochunarayanan. Lately she had a change of mind, to retreat from her wrong way of life, to be with her daughter who hated Ammini's activities. This provoked Adv. Thampi, as she knew many of their secrets, even to an extent more than they know of each other. He even had suspicion of her being the reason for the police storming the secret hide-out of Kamal. Nariman reports the four guilty of murder and the case reaches the same Sessions Court. The four were found to be guilty by Court, even with an experienced senior lawyer (Adv. Vaikuntam appearing for them against the inexperienced public prosecutor Adv. Sethulekshmi, the love interest of Nariman.
While the Judge reads his judgement, Nariman — to everyone's surprise — interrupt the Judge to say the four are innocent. He presents Ammini, the very same Ammini that the Court declared dead. He confesses his act on how the four became 'culprits' and how the case was framed using strong, but fake evidences (as in the couple murder case) that not even an experienced lawyer could expose. If an average police officer could easily deceive the Court, he exclaims what will happen if an evil genius with a group of powerful allies sets out on a rampage. If the Court, where common people seek justice, fails to stop them then there would be a state of anarchy where people won't hesitate to act worse. Through his drama, he pleads justice for Manu.
Although initially furious with his actions, the Judge realizes that the Court can be deceived at times and allows for a second hearing in Manu's case. Through the proceedings months after, Manu is found innocent by the Court and the guilty quadruplet — Adv. Thampi, Kochunarayanan, Philipose and Kamal — get their punishment.",

Clay had once loved Braxton's wife Kathy and still does.  When war is declared they soon find themselves fighting on opposite sides of the Civil War.
By 1864, Clay, now a field artillery major in the Confederate States Army, is renowned for accepting and surviving suicide missions. He is given another task: in order to delay General Sherman's March to the Sea, he is ordered to lead a party of men and their disassembled cannon inside caves that lead to the top of Devil's Mountain, where a battery of guns can destroy a railroad (running through nearby Snake Gap) and the Union troop and supply trains that travel it, buying time for the Confederacy. Devil's Mountain is coincidentally near Braxton's (who is now fighting elsewhere for the Confederacy) and Kathy's old plantation where Kathy remains with her uncle Albert. Kathy agrees to monitor the activities of the Northern invaders and to signal Clay's men from her window through a mirror by day and a lantern by night. At one point, having been caught signaling to Clay by one of the Union soldiers, Albert mortally wounds him before being shot dead himself. Through her activities, Clay's men are notified of the arrival of two supply trains and destroy both of them.
Will, now a major himself, arrives on the field, but the Union artillery cannot achieve the elevation or range with their cannon to clear the Confederate guns at the top of the mountain. Inside the mountain, the Union infantry cannot find the path to the top and are delayed by Confederate snipers. As the railroad line has been blocked by two destroyed trains, Union headquarters send a Dahlgren gun manned by sailors and mounted on a flat car to wipe out the Confederates. Kathy supplies Clay with wire from her piano to reinforce the barrel of one of Clay's guns that, with a double charge and the maximum elevation, is able to destroy the naval gun and further block the railroad line.
Will has Union Army engineers mine the inside of the mountain with explosives that will blow up the mountain. However, Clay calculates that the explosion will send the cliff down over the railway line further blocking the Union's supplies. Kathy begs Will that she be allowed to act as a mediator to convince Clay and his men to surrender, and Will agrees. As she traverses the caverns on the way to the top, Kathy is mistaken for a Union soldier and shot by one of Clay's soldiers. Bringing her to Clay, she repeats the Union offer of surrender as Clay nurses her wound. Ordering his men to escape Devil's Mountain, Clay picks up Kathy and begins making his way down. However, the powder is lit and Devil's Mountain explodes, seemingly killing Clay and Kathy.",

The only person she will not have sex with is Judd's friend Niles, an African American Vietnam War deserter, whom Vixen verbally abuses with racist insults.
A wealthy Irish tourist (who is really a Marxist Irish Republican Army sympathizer) entices the couple to fly him and – against Vixen's protestations – Niles to the United States.

His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt in Lavenham, England, who named him her sole heir.
Mario rushes to England and learns that his inheritance consists of not much; only thirteen antique chairs that have a certain value. He sells them to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his Aunt Laura's last message that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs, but is unsuccessful. With the help of lovely American antiques dealer Pat, who works in the antiques shop in front of Aunt Laura's house, where he sold the chairs, he launches a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes the duo from London to Paris, then to Rome. Along the way they meet a bunch of equally bizarre characters, including Albert, the driver of a furniture-moving van; a prostitute named Judy; Maurice, the leader of a traveling theater company that stages a poor version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; and Italian entrepreneur Carlo Di Seta and his vivacious daughter Stefanella.
The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the jewels finds its way into a truck and is collected by nuns who auction it off for charity. With nothing left to do as a result of the failure of his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship. Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him.
The film ends with Mario returning to New York City and his barber shop. His friends at the other (and more lavish) shop join him, as do two construction workers and his last customer, Randomhouse. It is there that Mario makes a strange discovery: shortly before his departure for Europe, he invented a way to make hair regrow miraculously.

The church is full of veterans who knew and loved him. Her mother Ethel Ann is sitting out on the church porch, smoking and nursing a hangover.
Ethel is indifferent to Chuck's death, which only her friend Jack Etty seems to understand. Marie is furious with her mother and with her implication that she slept with many of the veterans when they were all young, but then Ethel relents and says that she was always faithful. It emerges that there is a lot Marie does not know about her mother's past and the true story of her love life.
A young Ethel was in love with young farmer Teddy Gordon, who builds a house with his best friends Jack and Chuck. Her parents think she is dating ""good old reliable"" Chuck (all three are in love with her), but within days of the Pearl Harbor attack, she has accepted Teddy's gold ring and unofficially married him – with Jack and Chuck as witnesses. The three young men fly out the next day. Teddy and Jack are stationed at RAF Langford Lodge near Belfast, where Jack plans to eventually propose to Eleanor, an Irish tart.
In 1991 in Belfast Jimmy Riley, Eleanor's young adult grandson, encounters local elder Michael Quinlan, who is digging for wreckage of a crashed B-17 aircraft on nearby Black Mountain. Jimmy finds a ring at the site and determines to return it to the woman from the ""Ethel & Teddy"" inscription. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs identify an Ethel to whom crash victim Teddy Gordon left his belongings.
Jimmy flees The Troubles for Michigan to give Ethel the ring. She reveals a wall covered in souvenirs of Teddy, which Jack and Chuck boarded up for her shortly after his death in June 1944. Marie is shocked and furious to learn that her mother still mourns for him, finally understanding why Ethel shut out Marie and Chuck. Jack later tells her the full story, including his own three failed marriages, Ethel's refusal to leave the house Teddy built for her, and her taking ten years to marry Chuck. Jack's son, Pete, realizes Jack always loved Ethel.
Ethel travels to Belfast with Jimmy. As she holds the hand of a dying British soldier after an IRA car-bomb attack, Quinlan tells Ethel that he, as a teenager, was on Black Mountain when Teddy died. Teddy had him promise to give Ethel the ring, and tell her she must be free to make her own choice in love. Quinlan tearfully says he should have reached out to her back then, and that he had spent 50 years looking for the ring that was lost in the final blast that killed Teddy, now regretfully thinking she needed it as much as she needed his dying words.
Joining Ethel in Belfast, Jack confesses that he has always loved her. She is finally able to cry and properly grieve for Teddy. She and Jack embrace.",
